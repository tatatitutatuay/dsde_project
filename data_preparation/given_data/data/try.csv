"© 2018 Elsevier LtdComputational fluid dynamics was applied for sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) operating in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser. The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2k full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H2 flux of 0.301 kg/m2 s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H2 purity and the H2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height.","['Circulating fluidized bed', 'Computational fluid dynamics', 'Multiphase flow models', 'Riser', 'Sorption enhanced steam methane reforming']"
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic mesh was successfully prepared in a simple and environmentally friendly process by coating with fluoroalkylsilane-modified natural rubber-encapsulated silica latex (FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 ). TEM images confirmed the formation of a core-shell morphology, in which the rubber core was fully covered by a silica shell. This improved the thermal stability of the composites. Coating with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 enhanced both the hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the mesh. The depth profile of the XPS spectra revealed the presence of fluoroalkylsilane on the superhydrophobic mesh and Ar gas ion etching confirmed migration of the fluoroalkylsilane, SiO 2 and carbon to the mesh surface. SEM and AFM results quantified the surface roughness of the coated mesh. Meshes coated with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties. Surfaces coated with these encapsulated particles were successfully applied to oil/water separation. They exhibited a separation efficiency of up to 100% and were reusable across 30 cycles.","['Encapsulation', 'Fluoroalkylsilane', 'Natural rubber', 'Oil/water separation superhydrophobic/superoleophilic mesh']"
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. A label-free electrochemical DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-immobilized on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) was developed. Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R ct of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2–200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor.","['acpcPNA', 'Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Paper-based electrochemical DNA biosensor']"

The methodologies used in this paper are two folded. The first methodology is to develop a simulation model that allows manager to evaluate the impact of having different number of trailers on delivery and cost in order to identify the optimal fleet size. The second methodology is to use a Design of experiment (DOE) together with the simulation model to identify important factors that affect transportation performances. The result shows that the company should hire 16 trailers, which will reduce the delivery delay from 14% to 0.02%. Furthermore, it is found that variation in demand has a strong impact on late delivery and cost. There is also an interaction between demand variation and transportation time variation.","['Design of experiment', 'Optimal fleet size', 'Outsourcing', 'Simulation modelling', 'Transportation contract', 'Transportation management', 'Variation']"
"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle disorder affecting both males and females. Hemizygous males commonly present with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy during the neonatal period. Heterozygous females have great phenotypic variability. The majority of female patients can manifest later in life or have unrecognized symptoms, making the diagnosis of OTCD in females very challenging. Here we report on three unrelated Thai female cases with OTCD presenting with different manifestations including aggressive behavior, acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified disease-causing mutations in all three cases including two novel ones: the c.209_210delAA (p.Lys70Argfs*17) and the c.850T>A (p.Tyr284Asn). This study affirms variable symptoms in female patients with OTCD and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt management for favorable outcomes. In addition, identification of two novel causative variants expands the genotypic spectrum of OTC.","['Female', 'Hyperammonemia', 'Novel mutations', 'Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency', 'OTC']"
"© 2018 IEEE.Predicting court judgement has gained growing attention over the past years. Prior attempts used traditional prediction techniques based on Bag of words (BoW), where the order of words is discarded, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of criminal cases from Thai Supreme Court using End-To-End Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our model imitates a process of legal interpretation, whereby recurrent neural networks read the fact from an input case and compare them against relevant legal provisions with the attention mechanism. The model's output shows if a person is guilty of a crime according to the fact and laws. After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements. It features the text of fact expertly extracted from each judgement, textual provisions from Thai Criminal Code, and binary-format labels following the theoretical criminal law structure. This dataset is useful for achieving judgement predicting task together with emulating actual criminal case trial.","['Attention mechanism', 'Bi-directional GRU', 'criminal law', 'Deep Learning', 'predicting judgement', 'Thai Supreme Court']"
"© 2018The oxide layers of regular nanotubes structure were obtained on the surface of Ti–Zr alloys (Ti-6Al-4V-χZr (χ = 0, 20, 30, 40, 51)) by anodization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX) were used to characterize the morphology and composition of the nanotubes oxidized layers. The tribological property of the oxidized layers was evaluated using ball-on-disc wear tester. Neat microstructures can be obtained on all samples. With the addition of zirconium to the Ti-6Al-4V, the anodic oxidation is relatively intense, and the wear resistance of Ti-6Al-4V can be enhanced.","['Anodization', 'Ti–Zr alloy', 'Wear resistance']"
"© 2018 IEEE.Nowadays, misdiagnoses account for a significant portion of medical errors [1]. This is due to the fact that each physician's diagnosis is different depending on the physician's knowledge, skill, and experience. In several cases, physicians may ignore uncommon diseases. Also, after the diagnosis, the physician has to provide ICD-10-CM code. This is a difficult process for most (if not all) physicians. We propose a predictive model for classifying disease from symptoms by applying text mining technique. Our research technique allows physician to diagnose and to access an ICD-10-CM code directly from symptoms. Our models are based on several classifiers such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Models from each classifier were compared using training time, predicting time, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), precision and accuracy. The result suggests that Neural Network gives the best TPR at 89.03%.","['Classification', 'Data preparation', 'Disease', 'ICD-10-CM', 'Symptom', 'Text mining']"
"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Understanding in consumer behavior is an important task in the field of marketing. Dentsu's AISAS model is a model that has been proposed to describe consumer behavior. The model defines reaction when the consumer has seen advertising into five stages: attention, interest, search, action, and share. In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class. To overcome this problem, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was adopted and also combined with chi-square based feature selection technique. Varieties of feature sizes based on various classifier algorithms were compared. In the appropriate feature size, SMOTE could improve the classification performance in terms of recall and F1 score.","['AISAS model', 'Feature selection', 'SMOTE']"
"© 2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.A new class of quiescent galaxies harboring possible AGN-driven winds has been discovered using spatially resolved optical spectroscopy from the ongoing SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. These galaxies, termed ""red geysers,"" constitute 5%-10% of the local quiescent population and are characterized by narrow bisymmetric patterns in ionized gas emission features. Cheung et al. argued that these galaxies host large-scale AGN-driven winds that may play a role in suppressing star formation at late times. In this work, we test the hypothesis that AGN activity is ultimately responsible for the red geyser phenomenon. We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest-frame NUV - r color, axis ratio, and presence of ionized gas. We have used the 1.4 GHz radio continuum data from the VLA FIRST survey to stack the radio flux from the red geyser and control samples. In addition to a three times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies. After restricting to rest-frame NUV - r color >5 and checking mid-IR WISE photometry, we rule out star formation contamination and conclude that red geysers are associated with more active AGNs. Red geysers and a possibly related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M ∗/M o) < 11. Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale, relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies","['galaxies: evolution', 'galaxies: formation', 'galaxies: general']"

"© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The construction of a 2D–2D heterostructured composite is an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen generation capability under visible light. In this work, simple heat treatment of a mixture of g-C 3 N 4 and delaminated Ti 3 C 2 was used to prepare a series of d-Ti 3 C 2 /TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposites. The d-Ti 3 C 2 not only acted as the support layer and resource to glue the anatase TiO 2 particles and g-C 3 N 4 layers together but also served as the fast electron transfer channel to improve the photogenerated charge carriers’ separation efficiency. By tuning the g-C 3 N 4 /d-Ti 3 C 2 mass ratio, heating temperature and soaking time, the d-Ti 3 C 2 /TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite 4-1-350-1 achieved an excellent H 2 evolution rate of 1.62 mmol h −1 g −1 driven by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The heterostructured composite photocatalyst was stable even after 3 cycles, representing excellent potential for the practical application in solar energy conversion.","['2D materials', 'graphitic carbon nitride', 'heterostructured composites', 'hydrogen evolution', 'photocatalysis']"
"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThis study compares performance of different cavitation reactors for biodiesel production from palm oil using homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction systems. In addition, the effect of reaction volume of each reactor type was also investigated. For the smallest reaction volume of 165 mL, homogenizer and 20 kHz ultrasonic reactors offered the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield for both sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts. When the reaction volume was increased from 165 to 500 and 1000 mL with constant power input (80 W), homogenizer reactor did not significantly alter the rate of fatty acid methyl ester formation, unlike the other reactors which showed the decrease in the reaction rate. The reactor performance was evaluated in term of yield efficiency which was based on the amount of fatty acid methyl ester production, power consumption and reaction time. The increase of the reaction volume increased the yield efficiency of both the cavitation reactors and the mechanical stirred reactor. The highest yield efficiencies of 169.46 × 10−4 and 8.27 × 10−4 g/J were obtained from homogenizer reactor using sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts, respectively, using the reaction volume of 1000 mL. The homogenizer reactor also shows high flexibility of reaction volume usage with high biodiesel production performance in a batch system.","['Biodiesel', 'Cavitation reactor', 'Homogenizer reactor', 'Ultrasonic reactor', 'Yield efficiency']"

The study sample comprised listed companies in the ASEAN-4 countries-Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand-over the period 1972-2014. The K-medoids algorithm was employed in a cluster analysis, and the generalized method of moments (GMM) was applied to examine the dynamic relationship. The empirical results reveal that smaller companies tend to have higher growth than larger companies. Moreover, the results indicate that persistence of growth and persistence of profitability do not exist. There is also evidence that profitability affects companies' growth, but companies' growth does not affect profitability.","['ASEAN', 'GMM', 'Growth', 'Profitability', 'Size']"
"© 2018 by the authors.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease that is caused by a malfunction of carbohydrate metabolism, which plays an important role in the development of long-term diabetic complications. The excess glucose can be transformed to methylglyoxal (MG), a potential precursor of glycation. Glycation is a spontaneous non-enzymatic reaction that initially yields advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which ultimately triggers several severe complications. Therefore, the inhibition of AGEs formation is the imperative approach for alleviating diabetic complications. The aim of this research was to investigate the glycation and α-glucosidase inhibitory abilities of compounds isolated from fingerroot. The dichloromethane extract afforded three flavanones, two chalcones, two dihydrochalcones, and one kavalactone. Most of the isolated compounds showed higher inhibition effect against AGEs formation than aminoguanidine (AG). Subsequent evaluation in MG-trapping assay indicated that their trapping potency was relatively comparable to AG. Their structure-activity relationships (SAR) of MG-trapping activity were investigated using the comparison of the structures of flavonoids. In addition, pinocembrin displayed moderate α-glucosidase inhibition against both maltase and sucrose, with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.021 and 0.39 ± 0.020 mM, respectively.","['Advanced glycation end-products', 'Boesenbergia rotunda', 'Diabetes', 'Methylglyoxal', 'Pinocembrin', 'Structure-activity relationship', 'α-glucosidase']"
"© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Proton transport is one of crucial phenomena in electrolytic part highly considered to overcome a limit in fuel cell efficiency improvement. Proton conducting organic electrolyte was modeled and simulated at atomistic level of calculation by doping of butyl urocanate (C4U), a composite material with imidazole substructure, with sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) amorphous membrane at various working temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate structural and dynamics characteristic of C4U in the membrane comparing with the SPEEK-hydronium membrane model as a control. From simulations, thermal effect on water and proton carriers cluster surrounding the sulfonate groups was explored. At higher temperature, the more transport dynamics of C4U ions in SPEEK membranes were found than that of hydronium ions in the control system. Likewise, phase separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts was taken into consideration here. A critical role of the enhancing proton conductivity by increasing the diffusion coefficient at temperature beyond C4U melting point in composite polymer membrane was emphasized. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"© 2018 Elsevier LtdTuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs) and liquid column vibration absorbers (LCVAs) are good substitutes for mechanical dampers to counter seismic activity exerted to tall buildings. The existing simplified effective length method could predict good results corresponding to test outcomes on TLCDs and LCVAs with small transition zones, but is found to yield larger discrepancy as larger transition zones are needed, often due to limited space constraints. The numerical panel method could be effectively employed to give more accurate results, but is not simple to formulate and needs to be re-modified for each new configuration. This paper proposes a new quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method to simulate control characteristics of TLCDs and LCVAs with relatively large transition boundary between the vertical columns and the horizontal cross-over duct, since liquid velocity's variation inside the large transition boundary cannot be assumed to occur at a single point. The simulation results are compared with experimental investigations conducted on a shake table, yielding satisfactorily better outcomes for large transition zones, as well as for small transition zones. This new formulation has been verified with a few other studies and has been found to be an excellent viable option with a respectable better, or at least comparable, accuracy level.","['LCVA', 'Natural frequency', 'Panel method', 'Quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method', 'TLCD']"
"© 2018, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).Bacillus sp. strain M10 was observed to produce an antifungal protein that inhibits the growth of Colletotrichum capsici, which is the causal agent of anthracnose disease of chili pepper and tomato. Ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the protein was approximately 55.4 kDa. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and a subsequent sequence database search indicated the antifungal protein was most similar to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens vegetative catalase (KatA) protein. Light microscopy observation revealed that the antifungal protein induced abnormal hyphal elongation and conidial swelling and rupture. The protein considerably inhibited anthracnose development and protected the fruits from C. capsici infection. Thus, Bacillus sp. strain M10 and/or its putative catalase may be useful as a post-harvest biocontrol agent that protects chili pepper and tomato fruits from anthracnose disease caused by C. capsici.","['Antifungal', 'Bacillus', 'Catalase', 'Chili', 'Colletotrichum', 'Tomato']"
