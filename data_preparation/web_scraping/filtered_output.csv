"We show evidence of particle acceleration at GEV energies associated directly with protons from the prompt emission of a long-duration M6-class solar flare on July 17, 2023, rather than from protons acceleration by shocks from its associated Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), which erupted with a speed of 1342 km/s. Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) accelerated by the blast have reached Earth, up to an almost S3 (strong) category of a radiation storm on the NOAA scale.
Also, we show a temporal correlation between the fast rising of GOES-16 proton and muon excess at ground level in the count rate of the New-Tupi muon detector at the central SAA region.
A Monte Carlo spectral analysis based on muon excess at New-Tupi is consistent with the acceleration of electrons and protons (ions) up to relativistic energies (GeV energy range) in the impulsive phase of the flare. In addition, we present another two marginal particle excesses (with low confidence) at ground-level detectors in correlation with the solar flare prompt emission.","['sun:activity', 'high-speed stream', 'cosmic rays modulation']",['Brazil']
"Building open-ended learning agents involves challenges in pre-trained language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. LLMs struggle with context-specific real-time interactions, while RL methods face efficiency issues for exploration. To this end, we propose OpenContra, a co-training framework that cooperates LLMs and GRL to construct an open-ended agent capable of comprehending arbitrary human instructions.
The implementation comprises two stages: (1) fine-tuning an LLM to translate human instructions into structured goals, and curriculum training a goal-conditioned RL policy to execute arbitrary goals; (2) collaborative training to make the LLM and RL policy learn to adapt each, achieving open-endedness on instruction space.
We conduct experiments on Contra, a battle royale FPS game with a complex and vast goal space.
The results show that an agent trained with OpenContra comprehends arbitrary human instructions and completes goals with a high completion ratio, which proves that OpenContra may be the first practical solution for constructing open-ended embodied agents.","['Machine', 'Learning', 'ICML']",[]
"In the wake of large language models, there has been a resurgence of claims and questions about the Turing test and its value for AI, which are reminiscent of decades of practical “Turing” tests. If AI were quantum physics, by now several “Schrödinger’s” cats could have been killed. Better late than never, it is time for a historical reconstruction of Turing’s beautiful thought experiment. In this paper I present a wealth of evidence, including new archival sources, give original answers to several open questions about Turing’s 1950 paper, and address the core question of the value of Turing’s test.","['Alan', 'Turing', 'Turing test', 'Thought experiment', 'Foundations of', 'AI & computer science', 'Galileo', 'Galilei', 'History of science', 'History of', 'AI']",['Brazil']
"Online recruitment platforms typically employ Person-Job Fit models in the core service that automatically match suitable job seekers with appropriate job positions. While existing works leverage historical or contextual information, they often disregard a crucial aspect: job seekers’ social relationships in professional networks. This paper emphasizes the importance of incorporating professional networks into the Person-Job Fit model. Our innovative approach consists of two stages: (1) defining a Workplace Heterogeneous Information Network (WHIN) to capture heterogeneous knowledge, including professional connections and pre-training representations of various entities using a heterogeneous graph neural network; (2) designing a Contextual Social Attention Graph Neural Network (CSAGNN) that supplements users’ missing information with professional connections’ contextual information. We introduce a job-specific attention mechanism in CSAGNN to handle noisy professional networks, leveraging pre-trained entity representations from WHIN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations conducted across three real-world recruitment datasets from LinkedIn, showing superior performance compared to baseline models.","['Person-Job', 'Fit', 'Heterogeneous', 'Information', 'Network', 'Graph', 'Neural', 'Network']",['China']
"The prediction of tumor progression and chemotherapy response has been recently tackled exploiting Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and the nuclear protein Ki67 as prognostic factors.
Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve top results in estimating Ki67 expression and simultaneous determination of intratumoral TILs score in breast cancer cells. However,
in the last ten years the extraordinary progress induced by deep models proliferated
at least as much as their resource demand.
The exorbitant computational costs required to query (and in some cases also to store) a deep model represent a strong limitation in resource-limited contexts, like that of IoT-based applications to support healthcare personnel.
To this end, we propose a resource consumption-aware DNN for the effective estimate of the percentage of Ki67-positive cells in breast cancer screenings. Our approach reduced up to 75%percent7575\%75 % and 89%percent8989\%89 % the usage of memory and disk space respectively, up to 1.5×1.5\times1.5 × the energy consumption, and preserved or improved the overall accuracy of a benchmark state-of-the-art solution.

"The potential for augmenting the segmentation of brain tumors through the use of few-shot learning is vast. Although several deep learning networks (DNNs) demonstrate promising results in terms of segmentation, they require a substantial quantity of training data in order to produce suitable outcomes. Furthermore, a major issue faced by most of these models is their ability to perform well when faced with unseen classes. To address these challenges, we propose a one-shot learning model for segmenting brain tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, based on a single prototype similarity score. Leveraging the recently developed techniques of few-shot learning, which involve the utilization of support and query sets of images for training and testing purposes, we strive to obtain a definitive tumor region by focusing on slices that contain foreground classes. This approach differs from other recent DNNs that utilize the entire set of images. The training process for this model is carried out iteratively, with each iteration involving the selection of random slices that contain foreground classes from randomly sampled data as the query set, along with a different random slice from the same sample as the support set. In order to distinguish the query images from the class prototypes, we employ a metric learning-based approach that relies on non-parametric thresholds. We employ the multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) 2021 dataset, which comprises 60 training images and 350 testing images. The effectiveness of the model is assessed using the mean dice score and mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score. The experimental results demonstrate a dice score of 83.42, which exceeds the performance of other works in the literature. Moreover, the proposed one-shot segmentation model surpasses conventional methods in terms of computational time, memory usage, and the amount of data employed.","['brain tumor', 'magnetic resonance images', 'few-shot learning']",[]

"Context:The existence of low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) in their surfaces has challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed in the literature to explain these Li-rich giants involves the interaction with a close binary companion, a scenario that predicts that, when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems.
Aims:We aim to assemble the largest possible sample of low-mass giants with well-measured Li abundances, to determine with high statistical significance the close binary fractions of Li-rich and Li-normal giants, and thus test the binary interaction scenario for the emergence of Li-rich giants.
Methods:We develop a method that uses radial velocities (RVs) at three different epochs to quantify the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for the presence of a close binary companion. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We then assemble a sample of 1418 giants with available RVs from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH, to which we apply our variability classification. We can determine an evolutionary state for 1030 of these giants. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from the Gaia mission.
Results:When applying our methodology to the control samples, we find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs used in the analysis. For the set of RVs available for the giants, this accuracy is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that in the first ascent red giant branch (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, but we find some evidence that these fractions may be different for giants in the first-ascent RGB. Analysis of binary indicators in Gaia DR3 shows a smaller fraction of binary giants than our criteria, but no relation can be seen between Li enrichment and binarity either.
Conclusions:Our RV variability analysis indicates that there is no preference for Li-rich giants in the RC to be part of binary systems, thus arguing against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but measurable preference for having close companions, something that deserves further scrutiny with more and better data. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help in confirming and more robustly quantifying these results.",['stars: abundances – stars: evolution – binaries: general'],[]

"Research on algorithmic recourse typically considers how an individual can reasonably change an unfavorable automated decision when interacting with a fixed decision-making system.
This paper focuses instead on the online setting, where system parameters are updated dynamically according to interactions with data subjects.
Beyond the typical individual-level recourse, the online setting opens up new ways for groups to shape system decisions by leveraging the parameter update rule.
We show empirically that recourse can be improved when users coordinate by jointly computing their feature perturbations, underscoring the importance of collective action in mitigating adverse automated decisions.","['Recourse', 'Collective', 'Recourse', 'User', 'Agency']",[]
"Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory’s data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated have increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata, enable user-friendly retrieval, and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output.

In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. This paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. The paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing the databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among various facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources (personnel, time, budget, IT capabilities), type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.

"A critical function of an organization is to foster the level of integration (coordination and cooperation) necessary to achieve its objectives. The need to coordinate and motivation to cooperate emerges from the myriad dependencies between an organization’s members and their work. Therefore, to reason about solutions to coordination and cooperation problems requires a robust representation that includes the underlying dependencies. We find that such a representation remains missing from formal organizational models, and we leverage semantics to bridge this gap. Drawing on well-established organizational research and our extensive fieldwork with one of North America’s largest municipalities, (1) we introduce an ontology, formalized in first-order logic, that operationalizes concepts like outcome, reward, and epistemic dependence, and their links to potential integration risks; and (2) present real-world applications of this ontology to analyze and support integration in complex government infrastructure projects. Our ontology is implemented and validated in both Z3 and OWL. Key features of our model include inferable dependencies, explainable coordination and cooperation risks, and actionable insights on how dependency structures within an organization can be altered to mitigate the risks. Conceptualizing real-world challenges like incentive misalignment, free-riding, and subgoal optimization in terms of dependency structures, our semantics-based approach represents a novel method for modelling and enhancing coordination and cooperation. Integrated within a decision-support system, our model may serve as an impactful aid for organizational design and effectiveness. More broadly, our approach underscores the transformative potential of semantics in deriving tangible, real-world value from existing organization theory.","['Cooperation', 'Coordination', 'Dependence', 'Organization', 'Ontology', 'OWL', 'Z3']",[]
"We present a general framework for modeling materials using deep neural networks. Material represented by multidimensional characteristics (that mimic measurements) is used to train the neural autoencoder model in an unsupervised manner. The encoder is trying to predict the material parameters of a theoretical model, which is then used in a decoder part. The decoder, using the predicted parameters, reconstructs the input characteristics. The neural model is trained to capture a synthetically generated set of characteristics that can cover a broad range of material behaviors, leading to a model that can generalize on the underlying physics rather than just optimize the model parameters for a single measurement. After setting up the model we prove its usefulness in the complex problem of modeling magnetic materials in the frequency and current (out-of-linear range) domains simultaneously.","['materials modeling', 'deep neural networks', 'synthetic data']",['Poland']
"This paper proposes a computational model for policy administration.
As an organization evolves, new users and resources are gradually
placed under the mediation of the access control model. Each time
such new entities are added, the policy administrator must
deliberate on how the access control policy shall be revised to
reflect the new reality. A well-designed access control model must
anticipate such changes so that the administration cost does not
become prohibitive when the organization scales up. Unfortunately,
past Access Control research does not offer a formal way to quantify
the cost of policy administration. In this work, we propose to
model ongoing policy administration in an active learning
framework. Administration cost can be quantified in terms of query
complexity. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying
it to the evolution of protection domains. We also modelled
different policy administration strategies in our framework. This
allowed us to formally demonstrate that domain-based policies have a
cost advantage over access control matrices because of the use of
heuristic reasoning when the policy evolves. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to employ an active learning
framework to study the cost of policy deliberation and demonstrate
the cost advantage of heuristic policy administration.","['Access control', 'policy administration', 'active learning', 'query complexity', 'heuristics']",['Canada']
"Rollback recovery strategies are well-known in

"Demagnetization in ferromagnetic transition metals driven by a

physics, and its understanding is essential to the development of

the time-dependent quantum Liouville equation show a dramatic
enhancement in the amount of demagnetization after the inclusion of an
intraband term, in agreement with experiments. We also find that the

distinctly different because of their band structure and spin property

This transformative technology not only can enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability but also usher in a new era of cost-effective and smart maritime transportation in our increasingly interconnected world. This study presents a deep learning-driven anomaly detection system augmented with interpretable machine learning models for identifying performance anomalies in an industrial sensorized vessel, called TUCANA.

We empirically evaluate the system using real data acquired from the vessel TUCANA and the results involve achieving over 80% precision and 90% recall with the LSTM model used in the process.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a rapidly burgeoning field demonstrating significant potential in creating diverse contents intelligently and automatically.
To support such artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) services, future communication systems should fulfill much more stringent requirements (including data rate, throughput, latency, etc.) with limited yet precious spectrum resources.

"In this paper, we present a signal processing framework for directed graphs. Unlike undirected graphs, a graph shift operator such as the adjacency matrix associated with a directed graph usually does not admit an orthogonal eigenbasis.

We propose to extend the frequency domain and introduce a Fourier transform that jointly encodes the spectral response of a signal for the two eigenbases from the polar decomposition. This allows us to define convolution following a standard routine. Our approach has two features: it is lossless as the shift operator can be fully recovered from factors of the polar decomposition. Moreover, it subsumes the traditional graph signal processing if the graph is directed.

"As indoor applications grow in diversity, wireless sensing, vital in areas like localization and activity recognition, is attracting renewed interest. Indoor wireless sensing relies on signal processing, particularly channel state information (CSI) based signal parameter estimation. Nonetheless, regarding reflected signals induced by dynamic human targets, no satisfactory algorithm yet exists for estimating the acceleration of dynamic path length change (DPLC), which is crucial for various sensing tasks in this context. Hence, this paper proposes DP-AcE, a CSI based DPLC acceleration estimation algorithm. We first model the relationship between the phase difference of adjacent CSI measurements and the DPLC’s acceleration. Unlike existing works assuming constant velocity, DP-AcE considers both velocity and acceleration, yielding a more accurate and objective representation. Using this relationship, an algorithm combining scaling with Fourier transform is proposed to realize acceleration estimation. We evaluate DP-AcE via the acceleration estimation and acceleration-based fall detection with the collected CSI.

"We study solutions to systems of stream inclusions f∈T⁢(f)𝑓𝑇𝑓f\in T(f)italic_f ∈ italic_T ( italic_f ), where T𝑇Titalic_T is assumed to be causal in the sense that elements in output streams are determined by a finite history of inputs.
For solving these inclusions we develop a correspondence of causality
and contraction with respect to the prefix distance on streams.
Now, based on this causality-contraction correspondence, we apply fixpoint principles for the spherically complete ultrametric space of streams to obtain solutions for causal stream inclusions.
The underlying fixpoint iterations induce fixpoint induction principles for reasoning about solutions of causal stream inclusions.
In addition, these fixpoint approximations induce anytime algorithms for computing finite stream prefixes of solutions.

"This paper investigates block-level interference exploitation (IE) precoding for multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink systems. To overcome the need for symbol-level IE precoding to frequently update the precoding matrix, we propose to jointly optimize all the precoders or transmit signals within a transmission block. The resultant precoders only need to be updated once per block, and while not necessarily constant over all the symbol slots, we refer to the technique as block-level slot-variant IE precoding. Through a careful examination of the optimal structure and the explicit duality inherent in block-level power minimization (PM) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing (SB) problems, we discover that the joint optimization can be decomposed into subproblems with smaller variable sizes. As a step further, we propose block-level slot-invariant IE precoding by adding a structural constraint on the slot-variant IE precoding to maintain a constant precoder throughout the block. A novel linear precoder for IE is further presented, and we prove that the proposed slot-variant and slot-invariant IE precoding share an identical solution when the number of symbol slots does not exceed the number of users. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed precoders achieve a significant complexity reduction compared against benchmark schemes, without sacrificing performance.","['MU-MISO', 'block-level precoding', 'symbol-level precoding', 'power minimization', 'SINR balancing', 'interference exploitation.']",[]
"In this paper, we scale evolutionary algorithms to high-dimensional optimization problems that deceptively possess a low effective dimensionality (certain dimensions do not significantly affect the objective function). To this end, an instantiation of the multiform optimization paradigm is presented, where multiple low-dimensional counterparts of a target high-dimensional task are generated via random embeddings. Since the exact relationship between the auxiliary (low-dimensional) tasks and the target is a priori unknown, a multiform evolutionary algorithm is developed for unifying all formulations into a single multi-task setting. The resultant joint optimization enables the target task to efficiently reuse solutions evolved across various low-dimensional searches via cross-form genetic transfers, hence speeding up overall convergence characteristics. To validate the overall efficacy of our proposed algorithmic framework, comprehensive experimental studies are carried out on well-known continuous benchmark functions as well as a set of practical problems in the hyper-parameter tuning of machine learning models and deep learning models in classification tasks and Predator-Prey games, respectively.","['High-dimensional search', 'evolutionary multi-tasking', 'transfer optimization', 'random embeddings.']",[]

"Distributed computing in Blockchain Technology (BCT) hinges on a trust assumption among independent nodes. Without a third-party interface or what’s known as a ‘Blockchain Oracle’, it can’t interact with the external world. This Oracle plays a crucial role by feeding extrinsic data into the Blockchain, ensuring that Smart Contracts operate accurately in real time. The ‘Oracle problem’ arises from the inherent difficulty in verifying the truthfulness of the data sourced by these Oracles.

"This paper proposes a cyber-resilient distributed control strategy equipped with attack detection capabilities for islanded AC microgrids in the presence of bounded stealthy cyber attacks affecting both frequency and power information exchanged among neighboring distributed generators (DGs). The proposed control methodology relies on the construction of an auxiliary layer and the establishment of effective inter-layer cooperation between the actual DGs in the control layer and the virtual DGs in the auxiliary layer. This cooperation aims to achieve robust frequency restoration and proportional active power-sharing. It is shown that the in situ presence of a concealed auxiliary layer not only guarantees resilience against stealthy bounded attacks on both frequency and power-sharing but also facilitates a network-enabled attack identification mechanism. The paper provides rigorous proof of the stability of the closed-loop system and derives bounds for frequency and power deviations under attack conditions, offering insights into the impact of the attack signal, control and pinning gains, and network connectivity on the system’s convergence properties. The performance of the proposed controllers is illustrated by simulating a networked islanded AC microgrid in a Simulink environment showcasing both attributes of attack resilience and attack detection.","['AC microgrids', 'cyber-security', 'network-enabled attack detection', 'resilient control', 'stealthy attacks.']",[]

"Context:Solar filaments, also called solar prominences when appearing on the solar limb, consist of dense, cool plasma suspended in the hot and tenuous corona, which are the main potential sources of solar storms.
Aims:To understand the onset mechanism of solar filaments, we investigate the eruption process of an inverted U-shaped solar filament and two precursory jet-like activities.
Methods:Utilizing observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A), we investigate the event from two distinct observational perspectives: on the solar disk using NVST and SDO, and on the solar limb using STEREO-A. We employ both a non-linear force-free field model and a potential field model to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, aiming to understand its magnetic properties.
Results:Two precursor jet-like activities were observed before the eruption, displaying an untwisted rotation. The second activity released an estimated twist of over two turns. During these two jet-like activities, “Y”-shaped brightenings, newly emerging magnetic flux accompanied by magnetic cancellation, and the formation of newly moving fibrils were identified. Combining these observational features, it can be inferred that these two precursor jet-like activities released the magnetic field constraining the filament and were caused by newly emerging magnetic flux. Before the filament eruption, it was observed that some moving flows had been ejected from the site as the onset of two jet-like activities, indicating the same physical process as two jet-like activities. Extrapolations revealed that the filament laid under the height of the decay index of 1.0 and had strong magnetic field (540 Gauss) and a high twist number (2.4 turns) before the eruption. An apparent rotational motion was observed during the filament eruption.
Conclusions:We deduce that the solar filament, exhibiting an inverted U-shape, is a significantly twisted flux rope. The eruption of the filament was initiated by the release of constraining magnetic fields through continuous magnetic reconnection. This reconnection process was caused by the emergence of newly magnetic flux.","['Solar filament –', 'Solar filament eruptions –', 'Solar activity']",[]
"Context:The far-infrared (FIR) distribution at high Galactic latitudes,
observed with Planck, is filamentary with coherent structures in
polarization. These structures are also closely related to
H i filaments with coherent velocity structures. There is a
long-standing debate about the physical nature of these
structures. They are considered either as velocity caustics,
fluctuations engraved by the turbulent velocity field or as cold
three-dimensional density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Aims:We discuss different approaches to data analysis and interpretation in order to
work out the differences.
Methods:We considered mathematical preliminaries for the derivation of caustics
that characterize filamentary structures in the ISM. Using the
Hessian operator, we traced individual FIR filamentary structures in
H i from channel maps as observed and alternatively from data that
are provided by the velocity decomposition algorithm (VDA). VDA is
claimed to separate velocity caustics from density effects.
Results:Based on the strict mathematical definition, the so-called velocity
caustics are not actually caustics. These VDA data products may contain caustics
in the same way as the original H i observations. Caustics derived
by a Hessian analysis of both databases are nearly identical with a
correlation coefficient of 98%. However, the VDA algorithm leads to a
30% increase in the alignment uncertainties when fitting
FIR/H i orientation angles. Thus, the VDA velocity crowding concept
fails to explain the alignment of FIR/H i filaments at |b|>20⁢°𝑏20°|b|>20\degr| italic_b | > 20 °. We used H i absorption data to constrain the physical nature
of FIR/H i filaments and determine spin temperatures and volume
densities of FIR/H i filaments. H i filaments exist as cold neutral medium
(CNM)
structures; outside the filaments no CNM absorption is detectable.
Conclusions: The CNM in the diffuse ISM is exclusively located in filaments with FIR
counterparts. These filaments at high Galactic latitudes exist as cold
density structures; velocity crowding effects are negligible.","['clouds –', 'ISM: structure – (ISM:) dust', 'extinction –\nturbulence – magnetic fields – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)']",[]

"The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning.
Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots,
exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions.
Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to ×2absent2\times 2× 2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams ×6absent6\times 6× 6 larger than the number of robots at training time).","['Cooperative control', 'distributed systems', 'multi-robot systems', 'physics-informed neural networks', 'reinforcement learning.']",[]

"The intrinsic resolution is the primary limitation on the total energy resolution of LaBr33{}_{3}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT(Ce) crystal.

"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences.
In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization.
To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning.
To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations.
Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles.
Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty.
Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.","['Machine', 'Learning', 'ICML']",[]

"The intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies acts as a systematic effect in weak lensing measurements and tends to introduce biases. It mimics the gravitational lensing signal which makes it difficult to distinguish it from the true gravitational weak lensing effect. Hence, it is critical to account for the noise for correctly interpreting the results. This study aims at a quantitative analysis of IA using the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) model. We also investigate how the signals for shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing behave upon changing the parameters of the TATT model.
The data for this study was prepared with a computational pipeline based on the Cocoa model to explore the parameter space of the intrinsic shape signal.
Through this work, we identify that linear terms of the intrinsic shape signal are dominant in the case of GGL while the higher-order terms dictate the shear signal.","['Intrinsic', 'Alignments —', 'Weak', 'Gravitational', 'Lensing —', 'Tidal', 'Alignment —', 'Tidal', 'Torquing —', 'Cosmic', 'Shear —', 'Galaxy', 'Alignments']",[]
"The Multi-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming (MOMIP) problem is one of the most challenging. To derive its Pareto optimal solutions one can use the well-known Chebyshev scalarization and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers. However, for a large-scale instance of the MOMIP problem, its scalarization may not be solved to optimality, even by state-of-the-art optimization packages, within the time limit imposed on the optimization.
If a MIP solver cannot derive the optimal solution within the assumed time limit, it provides the optimality gap, which gauges the quality of the approximate solution. However, for the MOMIP case, no information is provided on the lower and upper bounds of the components of the Pareto optimal outcome.
For the MOMIP problem with two and three objective functions, an algorithm is proposed to provide the so-called interval representation of the Pareto optimal outcome designated by the weighting vector when there is a time limit on solving the Chebyshev scalarization. Such interval representations can be used to navigate on the Pareto front.
The results of several numerical experiments on selected large-scale instances of the multi-objective, multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem illustrate the proposed approach. The limitations and possible enhancements of the proposed method are also discussed.","['multi-objective mixed-integer programming', 'large-scale optimization', 'Chebyshev scalarization', 'Pareto front approximations', 'lower bounds', 'upper bounds']",[]

"Medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing and treating diseases. However, lacking medical images can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and ineffective treatments. Generative models offer a promising solution for addressing medical image shortage problems due to their ability to generate new data from existing datasets and detect anomalies in this data.
Data augmentation with position augmentation methods like scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, and translation could lead to more overfitting in domains with little data, such as medical image data.
This paper proposes the GAN-GA, a generative model optimized by embedding a genetic algorithm. The proposed model enhances image fidelity and diversity while preserving distinctive features. The proposed medical image synthesis approach improves the quality and fidelity of medical images, an essential aspect of image interpretation. To evaluate synthesized images: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is used. The proposed GAN-GA model is tested by generating Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) medical images, an image dataset, and is the first time to be used in generative models. Our results were compared to those of InfoGAN as a baseline model. The experimental results show that the proposed optimized GAN-GA enhances FID scores by about 6.8%, especially in earlier training epochs.

"Answering questions using pre-trained language models (LMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) presents challenges in identifying relevant knowledge and performing joint reasoning. We compared LMs (fine-tuned for the task) with the previously published QAGNN method for the Question-answering (QA) objective and further measured the impact of additional factual context on the QAGNN performance. The QAGNN method employs LMs to encode QA context and estimate KG node importance, and effectively update the question choice entity representations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We further experimented with enhancing the QA context encoding by incorporating relevant knowledge facts for the question stem. The models are trained on the OpenbookQA dataset, which contains ~6000 4-way multiple choice questions and is widely used as a benchmark for QA tasks.
Through our experimentation, we found that incorporating knowledge facts context led to a significant improvement in performance. In contrast, the addition of knowledge graphs to language models resulted in only a modest increase.

"Various popular multiplayer battle royale games share a lot of common elements. Drawing from our observations, we summarized these shared characteristics and subsequently proposed a novel heuristic algorithm named multiplayer battle game-inspired optimizer (MBGO).

Specifically, the movement phase incorporates the principles of commonly encountered “safe zones” to incentivize participants to relocate to areas with a higher survival potential. The battle phase simulates a range of strategies adopted by players in various situations to enhance the diversity of the population. To evaluate and analyze the performance of the proposed MBGO, we executed it alongside eight other algorithms, including three classics and five latest ones, across multiple diverse dimensions within the CEC2017 and CEC2020 benchmark functions. In addition, we employed several industrial design problems to evaluate the scalability and practicality of the proposed MBGO.

"Human Interaction Recognition (HIR) is the process of identifying and understanding interactive actions and activities between multiple participants in a specific environment or situation. The aim of this task is to recognise the action interactions between multiple people or entities and their meaning and purpose. Many single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has issues, such as the inability to capture global instance interaction features or difficulty in training, leading to ambiguity in action semantics. In addition, the computational complexity of the Transformer cannot be ignored, and its ability to capture local information and motion features in the image is poor. In this work, we propose a Two-stream Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network (THCT-Net), which exploits the local specificity of CNN and models global dependencies through the Transformer. CNN and Transformer simultaneously model the entity, time and space relationships between interactive entities respectively. Specifically, Transformer-based stream integrates 3D convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn inter-token correlations; We propose a new multi-branch CNN framework for CNN-based streams that automatically learns joint spatio-temporal features from skeleton sequences. The convolutional layer independently learns the local features of each joint neighborhood and aggregates the features of all joints. And the raw skeleton coordinates as well as their temporal difference are integrated with a dual-branch paradigm to fuse the motion features of the skeleton. Besides, a residual structure is added to speed up training convergence. Finally, the recognition results of the two branches are fused using parallel splicing. Multi-grained information modelling is employed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the action recognition system.

"Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of face forgery detection models in discriminating Artificial Intelligent Generated Content (AIGC). However, their security is significantly threatened by the injection of triggers during model training (i.e., backdoor attacks). Although existing backdoor defenses and manual data selection can mitigate those using human-eye-sensitive triggers, such as patches or adversarial noises, the more challenging natural backdoor triggers remain insufficiently researched. To further investigate natural triggers, we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis backdoor attack against face forgery detection models, which embeds natural triggers in the latent space. We thoroughly study such backdoor vulnerability from two perspectives: (1) Model Discrimination (Optimization-Based Trigger): we adopt a substitute detection model and find the trigger by minimizing the cross-entropy loss; (2) Data Distribution (Custom Trigger): we manipulate the uncommon facial attributes in the long-tailed distribution to generate poisoned samples without the supervision from detection models. Furthermore, to completely evaluate the detection models towards the latest AIGC, we utilize both state-of-the-art StyleGAN and Stable Diffusion for trigger generation. Finally, these backdoor triggers introduce specific semantic features to the generated poisoned samples (e.g., skin textures and smile), which are more natural and robust. Extensive experiments show that our method is superior from three levels: (1) Attack Success Rate: ours achieves a high attack success rate (over 99%percent\%%) and incurs a small model accuracy drop (below 0.2%percent\%%) with a low poisoning rate (less than 3%percent\%%); (2) Backdoor Defense: ours shows better robust performance when faced with existing backdoor defense methods; (3) Human Inspection: ours is less human-eye-sensitive from a comprehensive user study.",['Backdoor attacks face forgery detection facial attribute editing'],['China']
"Video-based facial affect analysis has recently attracted increasing attention owing to its critical role in human-computer interaction.
Previous studies mainly focus on developing various deep learning architectures and training them in a fully supervised manner. Although significant progress has been achieved by these supervised methods, the longstanding lack of large-scale high-quality labeled data severely hinders their further improvements.
Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, this paper introduces a self-supervised approach, termed Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver (SVFAP), to address the dilemma faced by supervised methods.
Specifically, SVFAP leverages masked facial video autoencoding to perform self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled facial videos.
Considering that large spatiotemporal redundancy exists in facial videos, we propose a novel temporal pyramid and spatial bottleneck Transformer as the encoder of SVFAP, which not only enjoys low computational cost but also achieves excellent performance.
To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning three downstream tasks, including dynamic facial expression recognition, dimensional emotion recognition, and personality recognition.
Comprehensive results demonstrate that SVFAP can learn powerful affect-related representations via large-scale self-supervised pre-training and it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.

When the input and its polar function are moreover uniformly log-concave, we prove that the functional volume product experiences a strict jump along the heat evolution. As a corollary of this, we confirm a conjecture due to Barthe–Böröczky–Fradelizi regarding stability estimates under the uniformly log-concave assumption.

To establish these results, we develop a new approach based on ideas from the regularizing effect of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck heat flow.

"In today’s era, users have increasingly high expectations regarding the performance and efficiency of communication networks.

"In contrast to the well-investigated field of SAR-to-Optical translation, this study explores the lesser-investigated domain of Optical-to-SAR translation, a challenging field due to the ill-posed nature of this translation. The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN), incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change weighted loss function.
Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods by eliminating the GAN’s fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions, resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have enhanced the model’s performance on all regions of the data.

"The following paper proposes a new target localization system design using an architecture based on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and passive radars (PRs) for integrated sensing and communications systems.
The preamble of the communication signal is exploited in order to perform target sensing tasks, which involve detection and localization.
The RIS in this case can aid the PR in sensing targets that are otherwise not seen by the PR itself, due to the many obstacles encountered within the propagation channel.
Therefore, this work proposes a localization algorithm tailored for the integrated sensing and communications RIS-aided architecture, which is capable of uniquely positioning targets within the scene.
The algorithm is capable of detecting the number of targets along with estimating the position of targets via angles and times of arrival.
Our simulation results demonstrate the performance of the localization method in terms of different localization and detection metrics and for increasing RIS sizes.","['integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)', 'reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)', '6G', 'localization', 'passive radar']",[]
"The limited energy and computing resources of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) hinder the application of aerial artificial intelligence. The
utilization of split inference in UAVs garners significant attention
due to its effectiveness in mitigating computing and energy requirements.
However, achieving energy-efficient split inference in UAVs remains
complex considering of various crucial parameters such as energy level
and delay constraints, especially involving multiple tasks. In this
paper, we present a two-timescale approach for energy minimization
in split inference, where discrete and continuous variables are segregated
into two timescales to reduce the size of action space and computational
complexity. This segregation enables the utilization of tiny reinforcement
learning (TRL) for selecting discrete transmission modes for sequential
tasks. Moreover, optimization programming (OP) is embedded between
TRL’s output and reward function to optimize the continuous transmit
power. Specifically, we replace the optimization of transmit power
with that of transmission time to decrease the computational complexity
of OP since we reveal that energy consumption monotonically decreases
with increasing transmission time. The replacement significantly reduces
the feasible region and enables a fast solution according to the closed-form
expression for optimal transmit power. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher probability of successful
task completion with lower energy consumption.","['Power control', 'tiny learning', 'energy-efficient', 'multiple-task split\ninference.']",[]
"Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) frequently power jets that interact with the interstellar/circumgalactic medium (ISM/CGM), regulating star-formation in the galaxy. Highly supersonic jets launched by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient medium. We build upon the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a smooth ambient medium, to include the effect of dense clouds that are an essential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this model is that the clouds along the supersonic jet-beam strongly decelerate the jet-head, but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much resistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities – cocoon pressure, head & cocoon speed, and jet radius. We obtain, for the first time, the analytic condition on clumpiness of the ambient medium for the jet to dissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical jets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is defined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the jet-head. We compare our models to more sophisticated numerical simulations, direct observations of jet-ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and discuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. Our work also motivates effective subgrid models for AGN jet feedback in a clumpy ISM unresolved by the present generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations.","['ISM: jets and outflows – galaxies: jets –', 'ISM: clouds – galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium']","['Israel', 'India']"

"Despite recent initiatives aimed at improving accessibility, the field of digital accessibility remains markedly behind contemporary advancements in the software industry as a large number of real world software and web applications continue to fall short of accessibility requirements.
A persisting skills deficit within the existing technology workforce has been an enduring impediment, hindering organizations from delivering truly accessible software products.
This, in turn, elevates the risk of isolating and excluding a substantial portion of potential users.
In this paper, we report lessons learned from a training program for teaching digital accessibility using the Communities of Practice (CoP) framework to industry professionals.
We recruited 66 participants from a large multi-national software company and assigned them to two groups: one participating in a CoP and the other using self-paced learning.
We report experiences from designing the training program, conducting the actual training, and assessing the efficiency of the two approaches.

"We considered two sequences of spiral galaxies with different shapes of the radial gas-phase oxygen abundance distributions from the galaxies in the survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies
at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA): (1) Galaxies in which the gradient is well approximated by a single linear relation across the whole disc, that is, galaxies with an S (slope)
gradients, (2) galaxies in which the metallicity in the inner region of the disc is at a nearly constant level and the gradient is negative at larger radii, that is, galaxies with
level-slope (LS) gradients. We also selected galaxies with a nearly uniform oxygen abundance across the whole galaxy, that is, galaxies with level (L) gradients (or O/H uniform
galaxies) with a high oxygen abundance that can be the final evolutionary stage of the two galaxy sequences described above. The radial nitrogen abundance distributions
in galaxies with LS oxygen abundance distributions also show breaks at radii smaller than the O/H distribution breaks. The observed behaviour of the oxygen and nitrogen
abundances with radius in these galaxies can be explained by the time delay between the nitrogen and oxygen enrichment together with the variation in the star formation history
along the radius. These galaxies clearly show the effect of the inside-out disc evolution model, which predicts that the galactic centre evolves more rapidly than
the regions at greater galactocentric distances. We find that the shape of the radial abundance distribution in a galaxy is not related to its macroscopic characteristics (rotation
velocity, stellar mass, isophotal radius, and star formation rate) and is independent of its present-day environment.
The correlations between the gradient slopes and macroscopic characteristics of galaxies are weak in the sense that the scatter of the points in each diagram is large.
The galaxies with different abundance distributions (S, LS, or L) in our sample are located within the main sequence of the star-forming
galaxies in the diagram of star formation rate – stellar mass. We also examined the properties of the Milky Way in the context of the considered galaxy samples.","['galaxies: abundances –', 'ISM: abundances –', 'H\u2009ii regions', 'galaxies']",[]
"The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) involves the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into industrial settings. However, given the high sensitivity of the industry to the security of industrial control system networks and IIoT, the use of software-defined networking (SDN) technology can provide improved security and automation of communication processes. Despite this, the architecture of SDN can give rise to various security threats. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider the impact of these threats on SDN-based IIoT environments. Unlike previous research, which focused on security in IIoT and SDN architectures separately, we propose an integrated method including two components that work together seamlessly for better detecting and preventing security threats associated with SDN-based IIoT architectures. The two components consist in a convolutional neural network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented as an SDN application and a Blockchain-based system (BS) to empower application layer and network layer security, respectively.
A significant advantage of the proposed method lies in jointly minimizing the impact of attacks such as command injection and rule injection on SDN-based IIoT architecture layers.
The proposed IDS exhibits superior classification accuracy in both binary and multiclass categories.","['Blockchain', 'Industrial', 'IoT', 'SDN', 'Deep learning', 'Intrusion detection system', 'and', 'Security.']",[]

"Generative models of expressive piano performance are usually assessed by comparing their predictions to a reference human performance.
A generative algorithm is taken to be better than competing ones if it produces
performances that are closer to a human reference performance.
However, expert human performers can (and do) interpret music in different ways, making for different possible references, and quantitative closeness is not necessarily aligned with perceptual similarity, raising concerns about the validity of this evaluation approach.
In this work, we present a number of experiments that shed light on this problem.
Using precisely measured high-quality performances of classical piano music,
we carry out a listening test indicating that listeners can sometimes perceive subtle performance difference that go unnoticed under quantitative evaluation.
We further present tests that indicate that such evaluation frameworks show a lot of variability in reliability and validity across different reference performances and pieces.

"Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability.
In this work,
we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users.
We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes.
The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints.
To address these challenges,
we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding.
For linear coding,
we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new
insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability.
We then propose an efficient algorithm
for joint encoder/decoder design.
For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding.
Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance.
We also demonstrate that our linear coding
excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while
our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs.
We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.","['Gaussian two-way channels', 'communication reliability', 'user cooperation', 'linear coding', 'neural coding']",[]

"Deep learning techniques have been applied in the context of image super-resolution (SR), achieving remarkable advances in terms of reconstruction performance. Existing techniques typically employ highly complex model structures which result in large model sizes and slow inference speeds.

"Context:The recent parameterisation by the GSP-Spec module of Gaia/Radial Velocity Spectrometer stellar spectra has produced an homogeneous catalogue of about 174,000 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Among the 13 chemical elements presented in this Gaia third data release, the abundance of two of them (cerium and neodynium) have been estimated in most of these AGB. These two species are formed by slow neutron captures (s𝑠sitalic_s-process) in the interior of low- and intermediate-mass stars. They belong to the family of second peak s𝑠sitalic_s-process elements.
Aims:We study the content and production rate of Ce and Nd in AGB stars, using the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances derived by the GSP-Spec module.
Methods:We define a working sample of 19,544 AGB stars having high-quality Ce and/or Nd abundances, selected by applying a specific combination of the GSP-Spec quality flags. We compare these abundances with the yield production predicted by AGB evolutionary models.
Results:We first confirmed that the majority of the working sample is composed of AGB stars by estimating their absolute magnitude in the K𝐾Kitalic_K-band and their properties in a Gaia-2MASS diagram. We also checked that these stars are oxygen-rich AGBs, as assumed during the GSP-Spec parameterisation. A good correlation between the Ce and Nd abundances is found, confirming the high quality of the derived abundances and that these species indeed belong to the same s𝑠sitalic_s-process family. We also found higher Ce and Nd abundances for more evolved AGB stars of similar metallicity, illustrating the successive mixing episodes enriching the AGB surface in s𝑠sitalic_s-process elements formed deeper in their stellar interior.

"We provide a step towards classifying Riemannian four-manifolds in which the curvature tensor has zero
divergence, or – equivalently – the Ricci tensor Ric satisfies the
Codazzi equation. Every known compact manifold of this type belongs to one
of five otherwise-familiar classes of examples. The main result
consists in showing that, if such a manifold (not necessarily compact or even
complete) lies outside of the five classes – a non-vacuous assumption –
then, at all points of a dense open subset, Ric has four distinct eigenvalues,
while suitable local coordinates simultaneously diagonalize Ric, the metric
and, in a natural sense, also the curvature tensor. Furthermore,
in a local orthonormal frame formed by Ricci eigenvectors, the connection form
(or, curvature tensor) has just twelve (or, respectively, six)
possibly-nonzero components, which together satisfy a specific system, not
depending on the point, of homogeneous polynomial equations. A part of the
classification problem is thus reduced to a question in real algebraic
geometry.","['harmonic curvature', 'Codazzi tensor']",[]

"In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task which targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT-NeRF, a Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details.
In detail, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT-NeRF is mainly composed of a One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer (Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D consistency.
Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that GD22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without per-scene finetuning.","['One-shot novel view synthesis', 'generalizable neural radiance fields', '3D reconstruction', 'GAN', 'diffusion model.']",[]

"As artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to expand, there is a growing need for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising to provide AI as a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider the DNN service providers share their computing resources as well as their models’ parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (CoDE) that facilitates coordination among DNN services by creating multi-task DNNs out of individual models. CoDE aims to find the optimal path that results in the lowest possible cost, where the cost reflects the inference delay, model accuracy, and local computation workload. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their own or other models’ parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a 75%percent7575\%75 % reduction in the local service computation workload while degrading the accuracy by only 2%percent22\%2 % and having the same inference time in a balanced load condition.

"Integrating sharded blockchain with IoT presents a solution for trust issues and optimized data flow. Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its nodes into parallel shards, yet it’s vulnerable to the 1%percent11\%1 % attacks where dishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing security with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional optimization.
This paper introduces a Trust-based and DRL-driven (TbDd) framework, crafted to counter shard collusion risks and dynamically adjust node allocation, enhancing throughput while maintaining network security. With a comprehensive trust evaluation mechanism, TbDd discerns node types and performs targeted resharding against potential threats. The model maximizes tolerance for dishonest nodes, optimizes node movement frequency, ensures even node distribution in shards, and balances sharding risks. Rigorous evaluations prove TbDd’s superiority over conventional random-, community-, and trust-based sharding methods in shard risk equilibrium and reducing cross-shard transactions.","['blockchain', 'sharding', 'collusion attacks', 'trustworthiness', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'internet-of-things']",[]
"Wind is one kind of high-efficient, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective energy source.
Wind power, as one of the largest renewable energy in the world, has been playing a more and more important role in supplying electricity.
Though growing dramatically in recent years, the amount of generated wind power can be directly or latently affected by multiple uncertain factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, etc.
More importantly, there exist very complicated dependencies of the generated power on the latent composition of these multiple time-evolving variables,
which are always ignored by existing works and thus largely hinder the prediction performances.
To this end, we propose DEWP, a novel Deep Expansion learning for Wind Power forecasting framework to carefully model the complicated dependencies with adequate expressiveness.
DEWP starts with a stack-by-stack architecture, where each stack is composed of (i) a variable expansion block that makes use of convolutional layers to capture dependencies among multiple variables;
(ii) a time expansion block that applies Fourier series and backcast/forecast mechanism to learn temporal dependencies in sequential patterns.
These two tailored blocks expand raw inputs into different latent feature spaces which can model different levels of dependencies of time-evolving sequential data.
Moreover, we propose an inference block corresponding for each stack, which applies multi-head self-attentions to acquire attentive features and maps expanded latent representations into generated wind power.
In addition, to make DEWP more expressive in handling deep neural architectures, we adapt doubly residue learning to process stack-by-stack outputs. Accurate wind power forecasting is then better achieved through fine-grained outputs by continuously removing stack residues and accumulating useful stack forecasts.
Finally, we present extensive experiments in the real-world wind power forecasting application on two datasets from two different turbines, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","['Wind', 'Power', 'Forecasting', 'Time', 'Series', 'Forecasting', 'Deep', 'Learning']",['China']
"Smart contracts are computer programs running on blockchains to automate the transaction execution between users.
The absence of contract specifications poses a real challenge to the correctness verification of
smart contracts.
Program invariants are properties that are always preserved throughout the execution, which
characterize an important aspect of the program behaviors.
In this paper, we propose a novel invariant generation framework, InvCon+, for Solidity smart
contracts.
InvCon+ extends the existing invariant detector, InvCon, to automatically produce verified
contract invariants based on both dynamic inference and static verification.
Unlike InvCon+, InvCon only produces likely invariants, which have a high probability to hold,
yet are still not verified against the contract code.
Particularly, InvCon+ is able to infer more expressive invariants that capture richer semantic
relations of contract code.
We evaluate InvCon+ on 361 ERC20 and 10 ERC721 real-world contracts, as well as common
ERC20 vulnerability benchmarks.
The experimental results indicate that InvCon+ efficiently produces high-quality invariant
specifications, which can be used to secure smart contracts from common vulnerabilities.","['Smart contract', 'invariant detection.']",['Singapore']
"Network embedding, which maps graphs to distributed representations, is a unified framework for various graph inference tasks. According to the topology properties (e.g., structural roles and community memberships of nodes) to be preserved, it can be categorized into the identity and position embedding. However, existing methods can only capture one type of property. Some approaches can support the inductive inference that generalizes the embedding model to new nodes or graphs but relies on the availability of attributes. Due to the complicated correlations between topology and attributes, it is unclear for some inductive methods which type of property they can capture. In this study, we explore a unified framework for the joint inductive inference of identity and position embeddings without attributes. An inductive random walk embedding (IRWE) method is proposed, which combines multiple attention units to handle the random walk on graph topology and simultaneously derives identity and position embeddings that are jointly optimized. In particular, we demonstrate that some random walk statistics can be informative features to characterize node identities and positions while supporting the inductive embedding inference. Experiments validate the superior performance of IRWE beyond various baselines for the transductive and inductive inference of identity and position embeddings.","['Random walk', 'inductive graph representation learning', 'node identity embedding', 'node position embedding.']",[]
"Acquisition and processing of point clouds (PCs) is a crucial enabler for many emerging applications reliant on 3D spatial data, such as robot navigation, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. In most scenarios, PCs acquired by remote sensors must be transmitted to an edge server for fusion, segmentation, or inference. Wireless transmission of PCs not only puts on increased burden on the already congested wireless spectrum, but also confronts a unique set of challenges arising from the irregular and unstructured nature of PCs. In this paper, we meticulously delineate these challenges and offer a comprehensive examination of existing solutions while candidly acknowledging their inherent limitations. In response to these intricacies, we proffer four pragmatic solution frameworks, spanning advanced techniques, hybrid schemes, and distributed data aggregation approaches. In doing so, our goal is to chart a path toward efficient, reliable, and low-latency wireless PC transmission.","['Wireless point cloud transmission', 'point cloud compression', 'semantic communication', 'DeepJSCC', 'NeRF.']",[]

Experimental results under two challenging scenarios demonstrate significant tracking accuracy improvements with negligible additional computational time compared to the conventional LMB filter.

"Space AI has become increasingly important and sometimes even necessary for government, businesses, and society. An active research topic under this mission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications (SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively train a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment of SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks.

In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a new communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among different orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and shells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire system. Our extensive simulations have validated the mathematical analysis and demonstrated the superior performance of NomaFedHAP in achieving fast and efficient FL model convergence with high accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art.","['Low', 'Earth orbit (LEO)', 'federated', 'Learning', 'high altitude platform (HAP)', 'non-orthogonal multiple', 'Access (NOMA).']",[]

"Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been successfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image and video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for meshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging off-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit the NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel Continuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two innovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based on the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of self-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally suitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more compactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function factorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group and across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the similarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows our method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data processing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising) and off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery) validate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared with state-of-the-art methods.","['Nonlocal self-similarity', 'low-rank model', 'tensor', 'Tucker factorization\nimage restoration', 'multivariate regression.']",[]

"Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is vital in improving traffic congestion, reducing traffic accidents, optimizing urban planning, etc.
However, due to the complexity of the traffic network, traditional machine learning and statistical methods are relegated to the background.
With the advent of the artificial intelligence era, many deep learning frameworks have made remarkable progress in various fields and are now considered effective methods in many areas.
As a deep learning method, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a highly competitive method in the ITS field since 2019 due to their strong ability to model graph-related problems. As a result, more and more scholars pay attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation domains, which have shown excellent performance.
However, most of the research in this area is still concentrated on traffic forecasting, while other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and urban planning, still require more attention.
This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs in six representative and emerging ITS domains: traffic forecasting, autonomous vehicles, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management.

"Context:
For decades, the spectral variations of β𝛽\beta\>italic_βPictoris have been modelled as the result of the evaporation of
exocomets close to the star, termed falling evaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a
hypothetical giant planet have been proposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is
now known to harbour two giant planets, β𝛽\beta\>italic_βPic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9 au and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected, the recent discovery of the latter complicates the picture.
Aims:We first question the stability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk of
planetesimals orbiting the star together with both planets to check the validity of the FEB generation mechanism.
Methods:Symplectic N-body simulations are used to first determine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable and which are not. Then we focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities, mainly thanks to resonant mechanisms.
Results:The first result is that the system is dynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion
resonance (MMR). Then, simulations with a disk of particles reveal that the whole region extending between
∼1.5similar-toabsent1.5\sim 1.5\,∼ 1.5au and ∼25similar-toabsent25\sim 25\,∼ 25au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a disk below 1.5 au survives, which
appears to constitute an active source of FEBs via high-order MMRs with β𝛽\beta\>italic_βPic c. In this new picture, β𝛽\beta\>italic_βPic b acts as a distant perturber that helps sustain the whole process.
Conclusions:Our new simulations rule out the preceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin
at around 4–5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in and related to MMRs with β𝛽\beta\>italic_βPic c. That mechanism also appears to last longer, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve towards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ from that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.","['Stars: circumstellar matter –', 'Stars: planetary systems –', 'Stars individual: β𝛽\\beta\\>italic_βPic–', 'Methods: numerical –', 'Celestial mechanics –', 'Planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability']",[]

"The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.","['Light field', 'Super-resolution', 'Image processing', 'Deep learning.']",[]
"Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life, making life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations may result in severe consequences, such as financial losses.
This requires to improve the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.
However, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural models.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree pruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems.
Our key insight is that a pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the original sentence.
Specifically, STP
(1) proposes a core semantics-preserving pruning strategy by basic sentence structures and dependency relations on the level of syntactic tree representation;
(2) generates source sentence pairs based on the metamorphic relation;
(3) reports suspicious issues whose translations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model.
We further evaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.
The results show that STP accurately finds 5,073 unique erroneous translations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with 64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively.

There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is 711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques.

"X-ray binaries are known to launch powerful accretion disk winds that can have significant impact on the binary systems and their surroundings. To quantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows, we need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in the theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool to understanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in nearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise to constrain the plasma number density, weakening the constraints on outflow location and mass outflow rate. We present a new approach to determine this number density in the X-ray binary Hercules X-1 by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to time-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly magnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s.

"Patient representation learning based on electronic health records (EHR) is a critical task for disease prediction. This task aims to effectively extract useful information on dynamic features. Although various existing works have achieved remarkable progress, the model performance can be further improved by fully extracting the trends, variations, and the correlation between the trends and variations in dynamic features. In addition, sparse visit records limit the performance of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-perspective Patient Representation Extractor (MPRE) for disease prediction.

Specifically, PRM-KD jointly distills diverse informative knowledge from multiple representative PRMs such as UniSRec, Recformer, and UniM22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTRec. The knowledge from the above PRMs are then smartly integrated into the student recommendation model considering their confidence and consistency.
We further verify the universality of PRM-KD with various types of student models, including sequential recommendation, feature interaction, and graph-based models.
Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of PRM-KD, which could be viewed as an economical shortcut in practically and conveniently making full use of different PRMs in online systems.","['Knowledge', 'Distillation', 'Pre-trained', 'Recommendation.']",[]
"Context:Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the primary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their H/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as (1 – 7) M⊙subscript𝑀direct-productM_{\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdOB and WR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy, but none of them have been identified so far.
Aims:We aim to provide comprehensive predictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their companions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations, to enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations, and to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy.
Methods: We expanded the previously considered space of parameters of progenitors of He-stars and applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the code MESA.

"By 2050, it is predicted that there will be 9 billion people on the planet, which will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of natural resources. It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate change will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or more significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known as agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of raising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible for it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity. The agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging technologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors, smart farming transforms traditional production methods and international agricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is optimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The agricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the fourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods with cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and efficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the agriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities, and other stakeholders is necessary. This paper covers Agriculture 4.0, looks at its possible benefits and drawbacks of the implementation methodologies, compatibility, reliability, and investigates the several digital tools that are being utilized to change the agriculture industry and how to mitigate the challenges.","['Smart', 'Farming', 'Agriculture 4.0', 'Precision', 'Farming', 'Sustainable', 'IoT', 'Security', 'Sensor']",[]
"Deep learning is the current de facto state of the art in tomographic imaging. A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then computes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on “in-distribution” test data similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data delocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field to perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures which leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of memory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on 1024 ×\times× 1024 images. In this paper, we introduce Glimpse, a local processing neural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by feeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to a simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful CNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, Glimpse significantly outperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost independent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024 ×\times× 1024 images. Further, we built Glimpse to be fully differentiable, which enables feats such as recovery of accurate projection angles if they are out of calibration.","['Deep', 'Learning', 'Computed', 'Tomography', 'MLP', 'Uncalibrated', 'Imaging']",[]
"High-frequency wide-bandwidth cellular communications over mmW and sub-THz offer the opportunity for high data rates, however, it also presents high pathloss, resulting in limited coverage. To mitigate the coverage limitations, high-gain beamforming is essential. Implementation of beamforming involves a large number of antennas, which introduces analog beam constraint, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated per transceiver chain (TRx). Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true time delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraint by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams per TRx, for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with “rainbow” beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. In this paper, we present a novel 3D beamforming codebook design aimed at maximizing beamforming gain to steer radiation toward desired azimuth and elevation directions, as well as across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users’ bandwidth requirements. We provide both analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam pattern. Through simulations of the beamforming gain, we observe that our proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art solutions reported elsewhere.

"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback. These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator’s role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond.","['Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'Large', 'Language', 'Models (LLMs)', 'ChatGPT', 'Multimodal', 'Learning', 'Cognitive', 'Theory of', 'Multimedia', 'Learning', 'Science', 'Education']",['Germany']
"Despite significant progress in deep learning-based optical flow methods, accurately estimating large displacements and repetitive patterns remains a challenge. The limitations of local features and similarity search patterns used in these algorithms contribute to this issue. Additionally, some existing methods suffer from slow runtime and excessive graphic memory consumption. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the RAFT framework. The proposed Attention-based Feature Localization (AFL) approach incorporates the attention mechanism to handle global feature extraction and address repetitive patterns. It introduces an operator for matching pixels with corresponding counterparts in the second frame and assigning accurate flow values. Furthermore, an Amorphous Lookup Operator (ALO) is proposed to enhance convergence speed and improve RAFT’s ability to handle large displacements by reducing data redundancy in its search operator and expanding the search space for similarity extraction. The proposed method, Efficient RAFT (Ef-RAFT), achieves significant improvements of 10% on the Sintel dataset and 5% on the KITTI dataset over RAFT. Remarkably, these enhancements are attained with a modest 33% reduction in speed and a mere 13% increase in memory usage.

"Locally harmonic manifolds are Riemannian manifolds in which small geodesic spheres are isoparametric hypersurfaces, i.e., hypersurfaces whose nearby parallel hypersurfaces are of constant mean curvature. Flat and rank one symmetric spaces are examples of harmonic manifolds. Damek–Ricci spaces are non-compact harmonic manifolds, most of which are non-symmetric. Taking the limit of an “inflating” sphere through a point p𝑝pitalic_p in a Damek–Ricci space as the center of the sphere runs out to infinity along a geodesic half-line γ𝛾\gammaitalic_γ starting from p𝑝pitalic_p, we get a horosphere. Similarly to spheres, horospheres are also isoparametric hypersurfaces.

We extend his result to all 1111-generated fields; in particular, to all fields F𝐹Fitalic_F such that the extension from the prime field of F𝐹Fitalic_F to F𝐹Fitalic_F is of finite degree.

"In distributed radar systems, when several transmitters radiate simultaneously,
the reflected signals
need to be distinguished at the receivers to detect various targets. If the transmit signals are in different frequency bands, they require a large overall bandwidth.
Instead, a set of pseudo-orthogonal waveforms derived from the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences could be accommodated in the same band, enabling the efficient use of available bandwidth for better range resolution.
In such a design, special care must be given to the ‘near-far’ problem, where a reflection could possibly become difficult to detect due to the presence of stronger reflections.
In this work, a scheme to detect multiple targets in such distributed radar systems is proposed.
It performs successive cancellations (SC) starting from the strong, detectable reflections in the domain of the Discrete Chirp-Fourier Transform (DCFT) after compensating for Doppler shifts, enabling the subsequent detections of weaker targets which are not trivially detectable.

imperfect bifurcations observed when families of standing waves are

divisors in the recursive algorithm and imperfect bifurcations in the
solution curves is observed, where the small divisor excites
higher-frequency parasitic standing waves that oscillate on top of the
main wave. A 109th order Padé approximation maintains 25–30 digits
of accuracy on both sides of the first imperfect bifurcation
encountered for the unit-depth problem. This suggests that even if the

"Data science pipelines commonly utilize dataframe and array operations for tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. The most popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing large-scale data.
Several systems have attempted to distribute data science applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data partitioning.
To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch between graph construction and graph execution.
Xorbits has been successfully deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk management in the finance industry.
Users can easily scale their data science workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code.
Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems.
Over the fastest state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66×\times× speedup on average. In terms of API coverage, Xorbits attains a compatibility rate of 96.7%, surpassing the fastest framework by an impressive margin of 60 percentage points.

Current methods use correlation measures between ROI’s blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals to generate the graph structure. Other methods use the training samples to learn the optimal graph structure through end-to-end learning. However, implementing those methods independently leads to some issues with noisy data for the correlation graphs and overfitting problems for the optimal graph. In this work, we proposed Bargrain (balanced graph structure for brains), which models two graph structures: filtered correlation matrix and optimal sample graph using graph convolution networks (GCNs).

"Rush hour and sustained traffic flows in eight cities are studied using the IBM Mega
Traffic Simulator to understand the importance of road structures and vehicle
acceleration in the prevention of gridlock. Individual cars among the tens of
thousands launched are monitored at every simulation time step using live streaming
data transfer from the simulation software to analysis software on another computer.
A measure of gridlock is the fraction of cars moving at less than 30% of their
local road speed. Plots of this fraction versus the instantaneous number of cars on
the road show hysteresis during rush hour simulations, indicating that it can take
twice as long to unravel clogged roads as fill them. The area under the hysteresis
loop is used as a measure of gridlock to compare different cities normalized to the
same central areas. The differences between cities, combined with differences
between idealized models using square or triangular road grids, indicate that
gridlock tends to occur most when there are a small number of long roads that
channel large fractions of traffic. These long roads help light traffic flow but
they make heavy flows worse. Increasing the speed on these long roads makes gridlock
even worse in heavy conditions. City throughput rates are also modeled using a
smooth ramp up to a constant vehicle launch rate. Models with increasing
acceleration for the same road speeds show clear improvements in city traffic flow
as a result of faster interactions at intersections and merging points. However,
these improvements are relatively small when the gridlock is caused by long roads
having many cars waiting to exit at the same intersection. In general, gridlock in
our models begins at intersections regardless of the available road space in the
network.","['traffic', 'cities', 'simulation', 'agent based', 'gridlock']",[]
"We report unbiased AI measurements of the fine structure constant α𝛼\alphaitalic_α in two proximate absorption regions in the spectrum of the quasar HE0515−--4414. The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ level. A 3σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100% 2424{}^{24}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 24 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTMg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial α𝛼\alphaitalic_α, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2σ𝜎\sigmaitalic_σ. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.","['Cosmology: cosmological parameters –', 'Cosmology: dark energy –', 'Cosmology: dark matter –', 'Galaxies: intercluster medium –', 'Electroweak interaction']","['Australia', 'Italy']"
"In this work, we consider the atypical non-equilibrium state found in [1708.06328] which holographically represents a behind-the-horizon excitation in a blackhole spacetime. The special feature of this state is that it looks like an equilibrium state when probed by a class of low-energy operators. First, we retrieve this property using the uniformization mapping in the limit of large central charge, in the process we are able to derive rather than presume approximate thermal physics.
Furthermore, in the large-c and high-energy limit we realize these excitations as elements of the commutant algebra of a GNS representation of the light operator algebra. Instead of analytically continuing a mixed heavy-light Euclidean correlator to a Lorentzian correlator, we identify the Euclidean correlator as a GNS linear form and interpret the Lorentzian correlator as a vacuum expectation value of representatives of the light operator algebra on the GNS vacuum.","['Conformal', 'Field', 'Theory', 'AdS/CFT', 'von', 'Neumann', 'Algebras']",[]

"The proliferation of social network data has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for extensive, data-driven exploration of human behavior. The structural intricacies of social networks offer insights into various computational social science issues, particularly concerning social influence and information diffusion. However, modeling large-scale social network data comes with computational challenges. Though large language models make it easier than ever to model textual content, any advanced network representation methods struggle with scalability and efficient deployment to out-of-sample users. In response, we introduce a novel approach tailored for modeling social network data in user detection tasks. This innovative method integrates localized social network interactions with the capabilities of large language models. Operating under the premise of social network homophily, which posits that socially connected users share similarities, our approach is designed to address these challenges. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method across seven real-world social network datasets, spanning a diverse range of topics and detection tasks, showcasing its applicability to advance research in computational social science.","['Social', 'Network', 'User', 'Detection', 'User', 'Behavior', 'Network', 'Homophily']",[]
"Using martingale theory, we compute, in very few lines, exact analytical expressions for various first-exit-time statistics associated with one-dimensional biased diffusion. Examples include the distribution for the first-exit time from an interval, moments for the first-exit site, and functionals of the position, which involve memory and time integration. As a key example, we compute analytically the mean area swept by a biased diffusion until it escapes an interval that may be asymmetric and have arbitrary length. The mean area allows us to derive the hitherto unexplored cross-correlation function between the first-exit time and the first-exit site, which vanishes only for exit problems from symmetric intervals. As a colophon, we explore connections of our results with gambling, showing that betting on the time-integrated value of a losing game it is possible to design a strategy that leads to a net average win.","['Martingale theory', 'First-passage processes', 'Brownian motion']",['Italy']
"As the deep learning revolution marches on, self-supervised learning has garnered increasing attention in recent years thanks to its remarkable representation learning ability and the low dependence on labeled data.
Among these varied self-supervised techniques, masked modeling has emerged as a distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that are proportionally masked during training.
This paradigm enables deep models to learn robust representations and has demonstrated exceptional performance in the context of computer vision, natural language processing, and other modalities.
In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the masked modeling framework and its methodology. We elaborate on the details of techniques within masked modeling, including diverse masking strategies, recovering targets, network architectures and more.
Then, we systematically investigate its wide-ranging applications across domains.
Furthermore, we also explore the commonalities and differences between masked modeling methods in different fields.
Toward the end of this paper, we conclude by discussing the limitations of current techniques and point out several potential avenues for advancing masked modeling research.

"Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) navigate underwater with a series of impulsive, click-like sounds known as echolocation clicks. These clicks are characterized by a multipulse structure (MPS) that serves as a distinctive pattern. In this work, we use the stability of the MPS as a detection metric for recognizing and classifying the presence of clicks in noisy environments. To distinguish between noise transients and to handle simultaneous emissions from multiple sperm whales, our approach clusters a time series of MPS measures while removing potential clicks that do not fulfil the limits of inter-click interval, duration and spectrum.
 As a result, our approach can handle high noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing approximately 40,000 clicks from multiple sperm whales; and a dataset from the Bahamas containing 1,203 labelled clicks from a single sperm whale. Comparing with the results of two benchmark detectors, a better trade-off between precision and recall is observed as well as a significant reduction in false detection rates, especially in noisy environments. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our database of labelled clicks along with our implementation code.","['Sperm whale clicks', 'passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)', 'real-time detection', 'Inter-pulse interval (IPI)', 'Inter-click interval (ICI).']","['Israel', 'Croatia']"
"Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations, which rely entirely on publicly available data such as social media, play an increasingly important role in solving crimes and holding governments accountable. The growing volume of data and complex nature of tasks, however, means there is a pressing need to scale and speed up OSINT investigations. Expert-led crowdsourcing approaches show promise, but tend to either focus on narrow tasks or domains, or require resource-intense, long-term relationships between expert investigators and crowds. We address this gap by providing a flexible framework that enables investigators across domains to enlist crowdsourced support for discovery and verification of OSINT. We use a design-based research (DBR) approach to develop OSINT Research Studios (ORS), a sociotechnical system in which novice crowds are trained to support professional investigators with complex OSINT investigations. Through our qualitative evaluation, we found that ORS facilitates ethical and effective OSINT investigations across multiple domains.

"A hybrid encryption (HE) system is an efficient public key encryption system for arbitrarily long messages.
An HE system consists of a public key component called
key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and a symmetric key component called data encapsulation mechanism (DEM). The HE encryption algorithm uses a KEM generated key k to encapsulate the message using DEM, and send the ciphertext together with the encapsulaton of k, to the decryptor who decapsulates k and uses it to decapsulate the message using the corresponding KEM and DEM components. The KEM/DEM composition theorem proves that if KEM and DEM satisfy well-defined security notions, then HE will be secure with well defined security.
We introduce HE in correlated randomness model where the encryption and decryption algorithms have samples of correlated random variables that are partially leaked to the adversary. Security of the new KEM/DEM paradigm is defined against computationally unbounded or polynomially bounded adversaries. We define iKEM and cKEM with respective information theoretic computational security, and prove a composition theorem for them and a computationally secure DEM, resulting in secure HEs with proved computational security (CPA and CCA) and without any computational assumption.
We construct two iKEMs that provably satisfy the required security notions of the composition theorem.
The iKEMs are used to construct two efficient quantum-resistant HEs when used with an AES based DEM.

"More than one hundred tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been detected at multi-bands, which can be viewed as extreme laboratories to investigate the accretion physics and gravity in the immediate vicinity of massive black holes (MBHs). Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically etsimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least 1111 yr−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT is ≳21.3greater-than-or-equivalent-toabsent21.3\gtrsim 21.3≳ 21.3, 21.221.221.221.2, and 21.521.521.521.5 mag in the u-, g-, and z-bands, respectively.

The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early-warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional early-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation processes involving in the TDEs.","['Accretion (14)', 'Gravitational lensing (670)', 'Supermassive black holes (1663)', 'Tidal disruption (1696)', 'Time domain astronomy(2019)', 'Transient sources (1851)']",['China']
"The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is increasing rapidly, hindering the large-scale deployment on resource-restricted devices (e.g., smartphones).
To mitigate this issue, AI software compression plays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high performance. However, the intrinsic defects in a big model may be inherited by the compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by adversaries, since a compressed model is usually deployed in a large number of devices without adequate protection. In this article, we aim to address the safe model compression problem from the perspective of safety-performance co-optimization. Specifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm in software engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training framework called SafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as safety testing, SafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following the dynamic sparse training paradigm.
Then, considering two kinds of representative and heterogeneous attack
mechanisms, i.e., black-box membership inference attack and white-box membership inference attack, we develop two concrete instances called BMIA-SafeCompress and WMIA-SafeCompress. Further, we implement another instance called MMIA-SafeCompress by
extending SafeCompress to defend against the occasion when adversaries conduct black-box and white-box membership inference attacks simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The results show the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework. We also discuss how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides membership inference attack, demonstrating the flexibility of SafeCompress.","['AI software safe compression', 'test-driven development', 'heterogeneous membership inference attack.']",[]
"Programming problems can be solved in a multitude of functionally correct ways, but the quality of these solutions (e.g. readability, maintainability) can vary immensely.
When code quality is poor, symptoms emerge in the form of ‘code smells’, which are specific negative characteristics (e.g. duplicate code) that can be resolved by applying refactoring patterns.
Many undergraduate computing curricula train students on this software engineering practice, often doing so via exercises on unfamiliar instructor-provided code.
Our observation, however, is that this makes it harder for novices to internalise refactoring as part of their own development practices.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to teaching refactoring, in which students must first complete a programming exercise constrained to ensure they will produce a code smell.
This simple intervention is based on the idea that learning refactoring is easier if students are familiar with the code (having built it), that it brings refactoring closer to their regular development practice, and that it presents a powerful opportunity to learn from a ‘mistake’.
We designed and conducted a study with 35 novice undergraduates in which they completed various refactoring exercises alternately taught using a traditional and our ‘mistake-based’ approach, finding that students were significantly more effective and confident at completing exercises using the latter.","['Refactoring', 'code smells', 'code quality', 'software maintenance', 'software engineering', 'mistake-based learning', 'undergraduate course']",['Singapore']
"In this paper, our objective is to present a constraining principle governing the spectral properties of the sample covariance matrix. This principle exhibits harmonious behavior across diverse limiting frameworks, eliminating the need for constraints on the rates of dimension p𝑝pitalic_p and sample size n𝑛nitalic_n, as long as they both tend to infinity. We accomplish this by employing a suitable normalization technique on the original sample covariance matrix. Following this, we establish a harmonic central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics within this expansive framework. This achievement effectively eliminates the necessity for a bounded spectral norm on the population covariance matrix and relaxes constraints on the rates of dimension p𝑝pitalic_p and sample size n𝑛nitalic_n, thereby significantly broadening the applicability of these results in the field of high-dimensional statistics. We illustrate the power of the established results by considering the test for covariance structure under high dimensionality, freeing both p𝑝pitalic_p and n𝑛nitalic_n.","['62H15', '62B20', '62D10', 'ultra-high dimension\ncovariance matrix central limit theorem limiting spectral distribution linear spectral statistics', 'M-P law']",[]
"Recent research at CHU Sainte-Justine’s Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PICU) has revealed that traditional machine learning methods, such as semi-supervised label propagation and K-nearest neighbors, outperform Transformer-based models in artifact detection from PPG signals, mainly when data is limited. This study addresses the underutilization of abundant unlabeled data by employing self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract latent features from these data, followed by fine-tuning on labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly enhances the Transformer model’s ability to learn representations, thereby improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks. Among various SSL techniques—including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO (self-distillation with no labels)—contrastive learning exhibited the most stable and superior performance in small PPG datasets. Further, we delve into optimizing contrastive loss functions, which are crucial for contrastive SSL. Inspired by InfoNCE, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function that facilitates smoother training and better convergence, thereby enhancing performance in artifact classification. In summary, this study establishes the efficacy of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data, particularly in enhancing the capabilities of the Transformer model. This approach holds promise for broader applications in PICU environments, where annotated data is often limited.","['clinical', 'PPG signals', 'self-supervised', 'contrastive learning', 'imbalanced classes', 'and artifact detection.']",[]

"The correctness of a compiler affects the correctness of every program written in the language, and thus must be thoroughly evaluated. Existing automatic compiler testing methods however either rely on weak oracles (e.g., a program behaves the same if only dead code is modified), or require substantial initial effort (e.g., having a complete operational language semantics).
While the former prevents a comprehensive correctness evaluation, the latter makes those methods irrelevant in practice.
In this work, we propose an axiomatic semantics based approach for testing compilers, called PTE. The idea is to incrementally develop a set of “axioms” capturing anecdotes of the language semantics in the form of (precondition, transformation, expectation) triples, which allows us to test the compiler automatically. Such axioms are written in the same language whose compiler is under test, and can be developed either based on the language specification, or by generalizing the bug reports. PTE has been applied to a newly developed compiler (i.e., Cangjie) and a mature compiler (i.e., Java), and successfully identified 42 implementation bugs and 9 potential language design issues.","['Compiler testing', 'language semantics', 'automated testing']","['Singapore', 'China']"

setting. The incorporation of multiple views in the domain adaptation was paid little attention in the previous studies. In this way, we propose an analysis of generalization bounds with Pac-Bayesian theory to consolidate the two paradigms, which are currently treated separately. Firstly, building on previous work by Germain et al. [7, 8], we adapt the distance between distribution proposed by Germain et al. for domain adaptation with the concept of multi-view learning. Thus, we introduce a novel distance that is tailored for the multi-view domain adaptation setting. Then, we give Pac-Bayesian bounds for estimating the introduced divergence.

"The goal of Continual Learning (CL) is to continuously learn from new data streams and accomplish the corresponding tasks.
Previously studied CL assumes that data are given in sequence nose-to-tail for different tasks, thus indeed belonging to Serial Continual Learning (SCL).
This paper studies the novel paradigm of Parallel Continual Learning (PCL) in dynamic multi-task scenarios, where a diverse set of tasks is encountered at different time points.
PCL presents challenges due to the training of an unspecified number of tasks with varying learning progress, leading to the difficulty of guaranteeing effective model updates for all encountered tasks.
In our previous conference work, we focused on measuring and reducing the discrepancy among gradients in a multi-objective optimization problem, which, however, may still contain negative transfers in every model update.
To address this issue, in the dynamic multi-objective optimization problem, we introduce task-specific elastic factors to adjust the descent direction towards the Pareto front.
The proposed method, called Elastic Multi-Gradient Descent (EMGD), ensures that each update follows an appropriate Pareto descent direction, minimizing any negative impact on previously learned tasks.
To balance the training between old and new tasks, we also propose a memory editing mechanism guided by the gradient computed using EMGD. This editing process updates the stored data points, reducing interference in the Pareto descent direction from previous tasks.
Experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness of our EMGD in the PCL setting.","['parallel continual learning', 'catastrophic forgetting', 'training conflict', 'multi-objective optimization', 'Pareto optimum.']",[]
"Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems.
Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years.
Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes.
Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes.
Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM).
We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies.
To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model’s robustness to modulation-related features.
Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our proposed framework serves as a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets.
We have verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the generalization of the models, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

"In robust optimization problems, the magnitude of perturbations is relatively small.
Consequently, solutions within certain regions are less likely to represent the robust optima when perturbations are introduced.
Hence, a more efficient search process would benefit from increased opportunities to explore promising regions where global optima or good local optima are situated.
In this paper, we introduce a novel robust evolutionary algorithm named the dual-stage robust evolutionary algorithm (DREA) aimed at discovering robust solutions.
DREA operates in two stages: the peak-detection stage and the robust solution-searching stage.
The primary objective of the peak-detection stage is to identify peaks in the fitness landscape of the original optimization problem.
Conversely, the robust solution-searching stage focuses on swiftly identifying the robust optimal solution using information obtained from the peaks discovered in the initial stage.
These two stages collectively enable the proposed DREA to efficiently obtain the robust optimal solution for the optimization problem.
This approach achieves a balance between solution optimality and robustness by separating the search processes for optimal and robust optimal solutions.
Experimental results demonstrate that DREA significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms across 18 test problems characterized by diverse complexities.
Moreover, when evaluated on higher-dimensional robust optimization problems (100-D𝐷Ditalic_D and 200-D𝐷Ditalic_D), DREA also demonstrates superior performance compared to all five counterpart algorithms.","['Evolutionary robust optimization', 'evolutionary algorithm', 'dual-stage strategy', 'peak detection']",[]

"Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to localize pixel points whose spectral features differ from the background. HAD is essential in scenarios of unknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop growth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of targets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect and distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost effortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human visual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze hyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer the solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first time. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which introduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual perception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also reduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target filter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being applied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional network knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial features of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the HAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set.

These standing kink oscillations have non-decaying amplitudes, and spectra that depend on the characteristics of the loops, with the latter amplifying the resonant frequencies from the drivers. We thus report for the first time in 3D simulations the manifestation of decayless oscillations from broadband drivers. The spatial and temporal evolution of our oscillation spectra reveals the manifestation of a half harmonic, which exhibits half the frequency of the identified fundamental mode with a similar spatial profile. Our results suggest that this mode is related to the presence of the transition region in our model and could be interpreted as being the equivalent to the fundamental mode of standing sound waves driven on pipes closed at one end.
Conclusions:The potential existence of this half harmonic has important implications for coronal seismology, since misinterpreting it for the fundamental mode of the system can lead to false estimations of the average kink speed profile along oscillating loops. Finally, its detection could potentially give us a tool for distinguishing between different excitation and driving mechanisms of decayless oscillations in observations.","['magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves', 'Sun: atmosphere', 'Sun: magnetic fields methods: numerical']",[]
"We present a fast and high-quality codec language model for parallel audio generation. While SoundStorm, a state-of-the-art parallel audio generation model, accelerates inference speed compared to autoregressive models, it still suffers from slow inference due to iterative sampling. To resolve this problem, we propose Group-Masked Language Modeling (G-MLM) and Group Iterative Parallel Decoding (G-IPD) for efficient parallel audio generation. Both the training and sampling schemes enable the model to synthesize high-quality audio with a small number of iterations by effectively modeling the group-wise conditional dependencies. In addition, our model employs a cross-attention-based architecture to capture the speaker style of the prompt voice and improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the baselines in prompt-based audio generation.","['Parallel audio generation', 'neural audio codec']",[]
"Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) is taking its first shape in WLAN sensing under IEEE 802.11bf, where standardized WLAN signals and protocols are exploited to enable radar-like sensing. However, an overlooked problem in JCAS, and specifically in WLAN Sensing, is the sensitivity of the system to a deceptive jammer, which introduces phantom targets to mislead the victim radar receiver. Standardized waveforms and sensing parameters make the system vulnerable to physical layer attacks. Moreover, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) makes deceptive jamming even easier as it allows digitally generated artificial range/Doppler maps. This paper studies deceptive jamming in JCAS, with a special focus on WLAN Sensing. The provided mathematical models give insights into how to design jamming signals and their impact on the sensing system. Numerical analyses illustrate various distortions caused by deceptive jamming, while the experimental results validate the need for meticulous JCAS design to protect the system against physical layer attacks in the form of deceptive jamming.","['Joint', 'Communication and', 'Sensing', 'WLAN', 'Sensing', 'deceptive jamming', 'physical layer security', 'OFDM radars.']","['Belgium', 'Sweden']"
"Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to different presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly critical concern.
Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well in intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To address this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to extract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder and the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and converge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to mitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input images, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain alignment.
Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks cannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and generative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that utilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors.
Specifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to transfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models are not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative tasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data.
By combining both DAA and dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge distillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing.
The advantage of our proposed method has been verified through extensive ablation studies and comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets across multiple protocols.","['Face', 'Anti-Spoofing', 'Knowledge', 'Distillation', 'Domain', 'Generalization', 'Adversarial', 'Attack']",[]

The main ingredient of the arguments lies in the construction of new Lyapunov functions, involving the coefficients, the stepsize, and θ𝜃\thetaitalic_θ, and the irreducibility and the strong Feller property for the STM.
We also generalize the arguments to the STM and its Galerkin-based full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by infinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise.

"In this paper, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed in a millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system. To alleviate the multi-hop attenuation, the semi-self sensing RIS approach is adopted, wherein sensors are configured at the RIS to receive the radar echo signal. Focusing on the estimation accuracy, the Crame´´e\acute{\text{e}}over´ start_ARG e end_ARGr-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the direction-of-the-angles is derived as the metric for sensing performance. A joint optimization problem on hybrid beamforming and RIS phase shifts is proposed to minimize the CRB, while maintaining satisfactory communication performance evaluated by the achievable data rate. The CRB minimization problem is first transformed as a more tractable form based on Fisher information matrix (FIM). To solve the complex non-convex problem, a double layer loop algorithm is proposed based on penalty concave-convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method with two sub-problems. Successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and second order cone (SOC) constraints are employed to tackle the non-convexity in the hybrid beamforming optimization. To optimize the unit modulus constrained analog beamforming and phase shifts, manifold optimization (MO) is adopted. Finally, the numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CRB minimization algorithm, and show the performance improvement compared with other baselines. Additionally, the proposed hybrid beamforming algorithm can achieve approximately 96% of the sensing performance exhibited by the full digital approach within only a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains.","['Integrated sensing and communications', 'reconfigurable intelligent surface', 'millimeter wave', 'Crame´´e\\acute{\\text{e}}over´ start_ARG e end_ARGr-Rao bound', 'beamforming.']",[]

"Tree-based models have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks, including time series forecasting.
They are increasingly in demand and widely accepted because of their comparatively high level of interpretability. However, many of them suffer from the overfitting problem, which limits their application in real-world decision-making. This problem becomes even more severe in online-forecasting settings where time series observations are incrementally acquired, and the
distributions from which they are drawn may keep changing over time. In this context, we propose a novel method for the online selection of tree-based models using the TreeSHAP explainability method in the task of time series forecasting. We start with an arbitrary set of different tree-based models. Then, we outline a performance-based ranking with a coherent design to make TreeSHAP able to specialize the tree-based forecasters across different regions in the input time series. In this framework, adequate model selection is performed online, adaptively following drift detection in the time series. In addition, explainability is supported on three levels, namely online input importance, model selection, and model output explanation. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on-par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.","['Online', 'Model', 'Selection', 'Tree-based', 'Models', 'Time', 'Series', 'Forecasting', 'TreeSHAP', 'Explainability']",[]

"Including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in embedded systems at the edge allows applications to exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities directly within devices operating at the network periphery, facilitating real-time decision-making. Especially critical in domains such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and healthcare, the use of ANNs can enable these systems to process substantial data volumes locally, thereby reducing latency and power consumption. Moreover, it enhances privacy and security by containing sensitive data within the confines of the edge device.
The adoption of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in these environments offers a promising computing paradigm, mimicking the behavior of biological neurons and efficiently handling dynamic, time-sensitive data. However, deploying efficient SNNs in resource-constrained edge environments requires hardware accelerators, such as solutions based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), that provide high parallelism and reconfigurability.
This paper introduces Spiker+, a comprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area customized SNNs accelerators on FPGAs for inference at the edge. Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNNs, a library of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python code. Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs (BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGAs, and power consumption, draining only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780μ𝜇\muitalic_μs/img. To the authors’ knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNNs accelerator tested on the SHD. In this case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAMs, with an overall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 μ𝜇\muitalic_μs for a complete inference on input data. This underscores the significance of Spiker+ in the hardware-accelerated SNN landscape, making it an excellent solution to deploy configurable and tunable SNN architectures in resource and power-constrained edge applications.","['Spiking', 'Neural', 'Networks', 'LIF', 'FPGA', 'Neuromorphic accelerator', 'Edge computing', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'Frugal', 'AI.']",[]

"Context
It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities.
However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities.
Objective
We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement.
Method
We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects.
We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.
Results
Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models.
The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models.
Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models.
Conclusion
Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention.

"Marker code is an effective coding scheme to protect data from insertions and deletions. It has potential applications in future storage systems, such as DNA storage and racetrack memory. When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state information (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to detect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to obtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to develop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect CSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker code based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning method, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker code. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights can be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which is an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit network. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed methods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm with CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits better error performances than other methods for unknown channel models.","['Bidirectional gated recurrent unit (bi-GRU)', 'deep unfolding', 'insertions and deletions', 'marker codes', 'model-driven deep learning.']",[]

However, manual annotation of fine-grained colorectal tissue samples of multiple classes, especially the rare ones like stromal tumor and anal cancer is laborious and expensive. To address this, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach, named KD-CTCNet, that effectively captures local texture information from few tissue samples, through a distillation loss, to improve the standard CNN features. The resulting enriched feature representation achieves improved classification performance specifically in low data regimes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets of colorectal tissues reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, with a consistent gain achieved over different approaches across low data settings.

"The electromagnetic inverse problem has long been a research hotspot. This study aims to reverse radar view angles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images given a target model. Nonetheless, the scarcity of SAR data, combined with the intricate background interference and imaging mechanisms, limit the applications of existing learning-based approaches.

Specifically, DSR generates SAR images at arbitrary view angles in real time. And the differences in sequential and semantic aspects between the view angle-corresponding images are leveraged to construct the state space in DRL, which effectively suppress the complex background interference, enhance the sensitivity to temporal variations, and improve the capability to capture fine-grained information. Additionally, in order to maintain the stability and convergence of our method, a series of reward mechanisms, such as memory difference, smoothing and boundary penalty, are utilized to form the final reward function.

Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational speeds and the vibration’s non-stationary nature.

First, we formulate the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their non-stationarity and the bearing’s inherent and operational parameters. We also elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in rolling-element bearings.

They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise ratios and performance metrics.

"Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex scenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge.

And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic combination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore, a differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed for CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image simulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the rapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real SAR images.

To derive the performance limitation, we adopt the semantic rate-distortion function (SRDF) to study the relationship among the minimum compression rate, observation distortion, semantic distortion, and channel capacity. For the case with unknown semantic source distribution, while only a set of the source samples is available, we propose a neural-network-based method by leveraging the generative networks to learn the semantic source distribution. Furthermore, for a special case where the semantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a cascade neural network to estimate the SRDF. For the case with perfectly known semantic source distribution, we propose a general Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to effectively compute the SRDF.

Under suitable conditions, we establish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with respect to the Bregman divergence of hℎhitalic_h, and prove linear convergence of the algorithm for τ=0𝜏0\tau=0italic_τ = 0 and exponential convergence for τ>0𝜏0\tau>0italic_τ > 0.
The results apply to common regularisers including relative entropy, χ2superscript𝜒2\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-divergence, and entropic Wasserstein costs.
This validates recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient methods.

"Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. [1]. The experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.","['Adversarial', 'Examples', 'Deep', 'Learning', 'Security', 'Adversarial', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Multi-Label', 'Classification', 'Mahalanobis', 'Distance', 'Non-Negative', 'Least', 'Square', 'Problems']",[]
"The current approach to fetal anomaly screening is based on biometric
measurements derived from individually selected ultrasound images.
In this paper, we introduce a paradigm shift that attains human-level
performance in biometric measurement by aggregating automatically
extracted biometrics from every frame across an entire scan, with
no need for operator intervention. We use a convolutional neural network
to classify each frame of an ultrasound video recording. We then measure
fetal biometrics in every frame where appropriate anatomy is visible.
We use a Bayesian method to estimate the true value of each biometric
from a large number of measurements and probabilistically reject outliers.
We performed a retrospective experiment on 1457 recordings (comprising
48 million frames) of 20-week ultrasound scans, estimated fetal biometrics
in those scans and compared our estimates to the measurements sonographers
took during the scan. Our method achieves human-level performance
in estimating fetal biometrics and estimates well-calibrated credible
intervals in which the true biometric value is expected to lie.","['Ultrasound', 'Fetal imaging', 'Machine learning', 'Bayesian estimation', 'Biometric measurement']",[]
"With the rapid development of machine learning and growing concerns about data privacy, federated learning has become an increasingly prominent focus. However, challenges such as attacks on model parameters and the lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning. Therefore, we propose a Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and promote the active participation of nodes in model training. Blockchain ensures that model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) remain unaltered. A novel adaptive differential privacy addition algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models, preserving the privacy of local models and preventing a decrease in the security of the global model due to the presence of numerous local models in federated learning. Additionally, we introduce a new mix transactions mechanism to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL outperforms baseline methods in both model performance and security.","['Federated', 'Learning', 'Blockchain', 'Differential', 'Privacy', 'InterPlanetary', 'File', 'System']",[]
"Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical applications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from estimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density images.
To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet).
Different from methods estimating density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that represent the precise localization of individuals.
This study designs a fusion module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid (FGFP), that is used to fuse feature maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet.
The fused features are then passed to both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence level for each predicted point being an individual.
At the end, FGENet establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points by employing the Hungarian algorithm.
For training FGENet, we design a robust loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of annotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd counting datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively, FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF_CC_50 dataset with an astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.","['Crowd counting', 'Computer vision', 'Convolutional neural network.']",[]

In this note, we show that both constructions are compatible, in the sense that the map from the torsion to the quotients is a mixed Hodge structure morphism.","['infinite cyclic cover', 'Alexander module', 'mixed', 'Hodge structure', 'thickened complex']",[]
"Traditional manual detection for solder joint defect is no longer applied during industrial production due to low efficiency, inconsistent evaluation, high cost and lack of real-time data. A new approach has been proposed to address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rates and computational cost of solder joint defect detection in surface mount technology of industrial scenarios. The proposed solution is a hybrid attention mechanism designed specifically for the solder joint defect detection algorithm to improve quality control in the manufacturing process by increasing the accuracy while reducing the computational cost. The hybrid attention mechanism comprises a proposed enhanced multi-head self-attention and coordinate attention mechanisms increase the ability of attention networks to perceive contextual information and enhances the utilization range of network features. The coordinate attention mechanism enhances the connection between different channels and reduces location information loss. The hybrid attention mechanism enhances the capability of the network to perceive long-distance position information and learn local features. The improved algorithm model has good detection ability for solder joint defect detection, with mAP reaching 91.5%, 4.3% higher than the You Only Look Once version 5 algorithm and better than other comparative algorithms. Compared to other versions, mean Average Precision, Precision, Recall, and Frame per Seconds indicators have also improved. The improvement of detection accuracy can be achieved while meeting real-time detection requirements.","['Solder joint defect', 'feature fusion', 'self-attention mechanism', 'feature pyramid network']",[]
"Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been proposed as an innovative 3D representation method. While attracting lots of attention, NeRF faces critical issues such as information confidentiality and security. Steganography is a technique used to embed information in another object as a means of protecting information security. Currently, there are few related studies on NeRF steganography, facing challenges in low steganography quality, model weight damage, and a limited amount of steganographic information. This paper proposes a novel NeRF steganography method based on trainable noise: Noise-NeRF. Furthermore, we propose the Adaptive Pixel Selection strategy and Pixel Perturbation strategy to improve the steganography quality and efficiency. The extensive experiments on open-source datasets show that Noise-NeRF provides state-of-the-art performances in both steganography quality and rendering quality, as well as effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography.","['neural radiation fields', 'steganography', 'implicit neural representation']",[]
"As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative mode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the edge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose coupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge, workflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the difficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management.
To address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme named KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge cloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine for KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and vertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge workflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and cloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to maximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task delay.
A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the cloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve cloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional roles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming among the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges for workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application collaboration.
Through a customized IoT application workflow instance, experimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total workflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the capabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.","['Workflow scheduling', 'cloud-edge collaboration', 'resource collaboration', 'application collaboration', 'horizontal roaming', 'vertical offloading.']",[]
"Context:Interstellar dust particles, in particular carbonaceous nano-grains (like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fullerenes, and amorphous hydrogenated carbon), are critical players for the composition, energy budget, and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM). The dust properties, specifically the composition and size of dust grains are not static; instead, they exhibit considerable evolution triggered by variations in local physical conditions such as the density and gas temperature within the ISM, as is the case in photon-dominated regions (PDRs). The evolution of dust and its impact on the local physical and chemical conditions is thus a key question for understanding the first stages of star formation.
Aims:From the extensive spectral and imaging data of the JWST PDRs4All program, we study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar — a well-known, highly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR situated at the intersection between cold, dense molecular clouds, and warm ionized regions. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on geometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution and the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our goal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to models. Taking advantage of the recent JWST data, in particular the spectroscopy of dust emission, we identify new constraints on dust and further previous works of dust modelling.
Methods:To characterize interstellar dust across the Orion Bar, we follow its emission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 μ𝜇\muitalic_μm) and MIRI (at 7.7, 11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 μ𝜇\muitalic_μm) broad band images, along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of carbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra and the predictions of the Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model for Interstellar Solids (THEMIS) coupled to the numerical code DustEM.
Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer simulations of dust emission with the SOC code (Scattering with OpenCL) and compare to data obtained along well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar.
Results:The JWST data allows us, for the first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at the illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with carbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive unprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain the observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the nano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas) 15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains. The lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating stars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found in the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger grains.

"The Riviera model is a combinatorial model for a settlement along a coastline, introduced recently by the authors. Of most interest are the so-called jammed states, where no more houses can be built without violating the condition that every house needs to have free space to at least one of its sides. In this paper, we introduce new agents (predators and altruists) that want to build houses once the settlement is already in the jammed state. Their behavior is governed by a different set of rules, and this allows them to build new houses even though the settlement is jammed. Our main focus is to detect jammed configurations that are resistant to predators, to altruists, and to both predators and altruists. We provide bivariate generating functions, and complexity functions (configurational entropies) for such jammed configurations. We also discuss this problem in the two-dimensional setting of a combinatorial settlement planning model that was also recently introduced by the authors, and of which the Riviera model is just a special case.","['generating functions', 'complexity function', 'configurational entropy', 'jammed configuration', 'maximal packing', 'settlement model', 'equilibrium lattice systems']",[]
"Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars offer a unique opportunity to study physics under extreme conditions. To fully exploit this potential, the interrelated problems of modelling radiative transport and the dynamical structure of the accretion flow must, however, be solved. This task is challenging both from a theoretical and observational point of view and is further complicated by a lack of direct correspondence between the properties of emission emerging from the neutron star and observed far away from it. In general, a mixture of emission from both poles of the neutron star viewed from different angles is indeed observed at some or even all phases of the pulse cycle. It is essential, therefore, to reconstruct the contributions of each pole to the observed flux in order to test and refine models describing the formation of the spectra and pulse profiles of X-ray pulsars. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven approach to address this problem using the pulse-to-pulse variability in the observed flux, and demonstrate its application to RXTE observations of the bright persistent X-ray pulsar Cen~X$-$3. We then discuss the comparison of our results with previous work attempting to solve the same problem and how they can be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of a toy model describing emission from the poles of a neutron star.","['Methods: data analysis –', 'X-rays: binaries –\npulsars: individual:', 'Cen~X$-$3–', 'Stars: neutron']",[]

We present the latest SDC dust density, size distribution, and flux measurements through 55 au and compare them to numerical model predictions. Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are thought to be the dominant source of interplanetary dust particles (IDP) in the outer solar system due to both collisions between KBOs, and their continual bombardment by interstellar dust particles (ISD).
Continued measurements through 55 au show higher than model-predicted dust fluxes as New Horizons approaches the putative outer edge of the Kuiper Belt (KB). We discuss potential explanations for the growing deviation: radiation pressure stretches the dust distribution to further heliocentric distances than its parent body distribution; icy dust grains undergo photo-sputtering that rapidly increases their response to radiation pressure forces and pushes them further away from the sun; and the distribution of KBOs may extend much further than existing observations suggest. Ongoing SDC measurements at even larger heliocentric distances will continue to constrain the contributions of dust production in the KB. Continued SDC measurements remain crucial for understanding the Kuiper Belt and the interpretation of observations of dust disks around other stars.","['Kuiper', 'Belt', 'Interplanetary', 'Dust', 'PVDF', 'New', 'Horizons']",[]
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied across various domains, yet they perform poorly in deep layers. Existing research typically attributes this problem to node over-smoothing, where node representations become indistinguishable after multiple rounds of propagation. In this paper, we delve into the neighborhood propagation mechanism of GNNs and discover that the real root cause of GNNs’ performance degradation in deep layers lies in ineffective neighborhood feature propagation. This propagation leads to an exponential growth of a node’s current representation at every propagation step, making it extremely challenging to capture valuable dependencies between long-distance nodes. To address this issue, we introduce Graph Elimination Networks (GENs), which employ a specific algorithm to eliminate redundancies during neighborhood propagation. We demonstrate that GENs can enhance nodes’ perception of distant neighborhoods and extend the depth of network propagation. Extensive experiments show that GENs outperform the state-of-the-art methods on various graph-level and node-level datasets.","['Graph', 'Neural', 'Network', 'Deep', 'Graph', 'Neural', 'Network', 'Graph', 'Self-Attention', 'Subgraph', 'Self-Attention', 'Algorithm', 'Framework']",['China']
"From politicians to podcast hosts, online platforms have systematically banned (“deplatformed”) influential users for breaking platform guidelines.
Previous inquiries on the effectiveness of this intervention are inconclusive because
1) they consider only few deplatforming events;
2) they consider only overt engagement traces (e.g., likes and posts) but not passive engagement (e.g., views);
3) they do not consider all the potential places users impacted by the deplatforming event might migrate to.
We address these limitations in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at 101 influencers.
We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then manually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of deplatforming events.
Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia page views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the general public’s interest in specific influencers.
Through a difference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online attention toward influencers.
After 12 months, we estimate that online attention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by
−--63% (95% CI [−--75%,−--46%]) on Google and by
−--43% (95% CI [−--57%,−--24%]) on Wikipedia.
Further, as we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases deplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the intervention.

"In this paper, we examine the parameter estimation performance of three well-known sinusoidal models for speech and audio. The first one is the standard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has been proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter estimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM), which has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the signal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are adaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation of each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the others in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a variety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real signals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing voices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are presented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is discussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size analysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis window sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of adaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a new paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio signals.","['Sinusoidal', 'Model', 'adaptive', 'Quasi-Harmonic', 'Model', 'Exponentially', 'Damped', 'Sinusoids', 'Parameter', 'Estimation', 'Speech', 'Analysis', 'Audio', 'Analysis']",[]
"This paper documents a year-long experiment to “profile” the process of learning a programming language: gathering data to understand what makes a language hard to learn, and using that data to improve the learning process. We added interactive quizzes to The Rust Programming Language, the official textbook for learning Rust. Over 13 months, 62,526 readers answered questions 1,140,202 times. First, we analyze the trajectories of readers. We find that many readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language concepts like Rust’s ownership types. Second, we use classical test theory and item response theory to analyze the characteristics of quiz questions. We find that better questions are more conceptual in nature, such as asking why a program does not compile vs. whether a program compiles. Third, we performed 12 interventions into the book to help readers with difficult questions. We find that on average, interventions improved quiz scores on the targeted questions by +20%. Fourth, we show that our technique can likely generalize to languages with smaller user bases by simulating our statistical inferences on small N𝑁Nitalic_N.

"In deep learning, classification tasks are formalized as optimization problems solved via the minimization of the cross-entropy.
However, recent advancements in the design of objective functions allow the f𝑓fitalic_f-divergence measure to generalize the formulation of the optimization problem for classification.

First, we theoretically prove the convergence property of the posterior probability estimators.

We also integrate a residual vector quantization (RVQ) mechanism for effective multilevel communication. In the second stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is introduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving as a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature restoration.

The merged particles evolve indistinguishably from the non-merged ones, i.e. they move at constant velocity until a new plastic collision eventually happens.
As in any open system, the particles are not confined to any region or reservoir, so as time progresses, they go on to infinity.

The basic idea is to construct bi-level attention information: the group level and the neighbor level. The two levels are computed by the original model’s self-attention, which means the proposed does not require any training. With only four lines of code modification, the proposed method can effortlessly extend existing LLMs’ context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the results show that the proposed method can effectively extend existing LLMs’ context window’s length.","['Machine', 'Learning', 'ICML']",[]
"This paper studies how to recover parameters in diagonal Gaussian mixture models using tensors. High-order moments of the Gaussian mixture model are estimated from samples. They form incomplete symmetric tensors generated by hidden parameters in the model. We propose to use generating polynomials to compute incomplete symmetric tensor approximations. The obtained decomposition is utilized to recover parameters in the model. We prove that our recovered parameters are accurate when the estimated moments are accurate. Using high-order moments enables our algorithm to learn Gaussian mixtures with more components. For a given model dimension and order, we provide an upper bound of the number of components in the Gaussian mixture model that our algorithm can compute.","['Gaussian mixture', 'symmetric tensor decomposition', 'generating polynomial', 'moments']",[]

"If the extraction of sensor fingerprints represents nowadays an important forensic tool for sensor attribution, it has been shown recently in [1, 2, 3] that images coming from several sensors were more prone to generate False Positives (FP) by presenting a common ”leak”. In this paper, we investigate the possible cause of this leak and after inspecting the EXIF metadata of the sources causing FP, we found out that they were related to the Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop softwares. The cross-correlation between residuals on images presenting FP reveals periodic peaks showing the presence of a periodic pattern. By developing our own images with Adobe Lightroom we are able to show that all developments from raw images (or 16 bits per channel coded) to 8 bits-coded images also embed a periodic 128×128128128128\times 128128 × 128 pattern very similar to a watermark. However, we also show that the watermark depends on both the content and the architecture used to develop the image. The rest of the paper presents two different ways of removing this watermark, one by removing it from the image noise component, and the other by removing it in the pixel domain. We show that for a camera presenting FP in [3], we were able to prevent the False Positives.

"Recommender systems aim to recommend the most suitable items to users from a large number of candidates. Their computation cost grows as the number of user requests and the complexity of services (or models) increases.
Under the limitation of computation resources (CRs), how to make a trade-off between computation cost and business revenue becomes an essential question.
The existing studies focus on dynamically allocating CRs in queue truncation scenarios (i.e., allocating the size of candidates), and formulate the CR allocation problem as an optimization problem with constraints. Some of them focus on single-phase CR allocation, and others focus on multi-phase CR allocation but introduce some assumptions about queue truncation scenarios. However, these assumptions do not hold in other scenarios, such as retrieval channel selection and prediction model selection. Moreover, existing studies ignore the state transition process of requests between different phases, limiting the effectiveness of their approaches.
This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Multi-Phase Computation Allocation approach (RL-MPCA), which aims to maximize the total business revenue under the limitation of CRs. RL-MPCA formulates the CR allocation problem as a Weakly Coupled MDP problem and solves it with an RL-based approach. Specifically, RL-MPCA designs a novel deep Q-network to adapt to various CR allocation scenarios, and calibrates the Q-value by introducing multiple adaptive Lagrange multipliers (adaptive-λ𝜆\lambdaitalic_λ) to avoid violating the global CR constraints.
Finally, experiments on the offline simulation environment and online real-world recommender system validate the effectiveness of our approach.","['Computation', 'Resource', 'Allocation', 'Deep', 'Reinforcement', 'Learning', 'Recommender', 'System', 'Weakly', 'Coupled', 'MDP']",['China']
"Spurred by consistent advances and innovation in deep learning, object detection applications have become prevalent, particularly in autonomous driving that leverages various visual data. As convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being optimized, the performances and computation speeds of object detection in autonomous driving have been significantly improved. However, due to the exponentially rapid growth in the complexity and scale of data used in object detection, there are limitations in terms of computation speeds while conducting object detection solely with classical computing. Motivated by this, quantum convolution-based object detection (QCOD) is proposed to adopt quantum computing to perform object detection at high speed. The QCOD utilizes our proposed fast quantum convolution that uploads input channel information and re-constructs output channels for achieving reduced computational complexity and thus improving performances. Lastly, the extensive experiments with KITTI autonomous driving object detection dataset verify that the proposed fast quantum convolution and QCOD are successfully operated in real object detection applications.","['Quantum', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Quantum', 'Convolutional', 'Neural', 'Network', 'Object', 'Detection', 'Autonomous', 'Driving']",[]
"WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR) enables contactless, long-range sensing in spatially constrained environments while preserving visual privacy. However, despite the presence of numerous WiFi-enabled devices around us, few expose CSI to users, resulting in a lack of sensing hardware options. Variants of the Espressif ESP32 have emerged as potential low-cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for WiFi CSI-based HAR. In this work, four ESP32-S3-based 2.4GHz directional antenna systems are evaluated for their ability to facilitate long-range through-wall HAR. Two promising systems are proposed, one of which combines the ESP32-S3 with a directional biquad antenna. This combination represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of such a system in WiFi-based HAR. The second system relies on the built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) of the ESP32-S3 and achieves directionality through a plane reflector. In a comprehensive evaluation of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) HAR performance, both systems are deployed in an office environment spanning a distance of 18 meters across five rooms. In this experimental setup, the Wallhack1.8k dataset, comprising 1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities, is collected and made publicly available. Based on Wallhack1.8k, we train activity recognition models using the EfficientNetV2 architecture to assess system performance in LOS and NLOS scenarios. For the core NLOS activity recognition problem, the biquad antenna and PIFA-based systems achieve accuracies of 92.0±plus-or-minus\pm±3.5 and 86.8±plus-or-minus\pm±4.7, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of long-range through-wall HAR with the proposed systems.","['Human', 'Activity', 'Recognition', 'WiFi', 'Channel', 'State', 'Information', 'Through-Wall', 'Sensing', 'ESP32']",[]
"Neural implicit fields, such as the neural signed distance field (SDF) of a shape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g., encoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit fields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding (PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side effect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned implicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate these artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon through the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the appropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field without undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with randomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network’s responses. It is observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than the highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this intrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to determine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the setting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to secure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate would not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped MLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the existing methods.","['SDF', 'neural representation', 'positional encoding', 'Fourier analysis', 'spectrum analysis', 'neural network.']",[]
"Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) as an effective and robust framework for handling uncertain information is applied in decision-making and pattern classification. Unfortunately, its real-time application is limited by the exponential computational complexity. People attempt to address the issue by taking advantage of its mathematical consistency with quantum computing to implement DST operations on quantum circuits and realize speedup. However, the progress so far is still impractical for supporting large-scale DST applications. In this paper, we find that Boolean algebra as an essential mathematical tool bridges the definition of DST and quantum computing. Based on the discovery, we establish a flexible framework mapping any set-theoretically defined DST operations to corresponding quantum circuits for implementation. More critically, this new framework is not only uniform but also enables exponential acceleration for computation and is capable of handling complex applications. Focusing on tasks of classification, we based on a classical attribute fusion algorithm putting forward a quantum evidential classifier, where quantum mass functions for attributes are generated with a simple method and the proposed framework is applied for fusing the attribute evidence. Compared to previous methods, the proposed quantum classifier exponentially reduces the computational complexity to linear.

"Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments, and hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability amongst significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light curve properties: (1) LW2≳1042greater-than-or-equivalent-tosubscript𝐿W2superscript1042L_{\mathrm{W2}}\gtrsim 10^{42}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT W2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≳ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 42 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg s−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT at peak, (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline, (3) no significant prior variability, and (4) no evidence for AGN activity in WISE colors.

Using narrow line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified 6 sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample.

"Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and geographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by temporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the cost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy microservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource configuration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload variations.
However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since applications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new resource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update scheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization problem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same regional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service disruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the need to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the updated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that effectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero service disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed schemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service disruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes replicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.","['Microservice re-orchestration', 'cost minimization', 'resource allocation', 'multi-cloud systems', 'optimization']",[]
"Context:Twenty-two extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) have now been discovered from two decades of Chandra data (analyzing ∼similar-to{\sim}∼259 Ms of data), with 17 associated with distant galaxies (≳greater-than-or-equivalent-to{\gtrsim}≳100 Mpc). Different mechanisms and progenitors have been proposed to explain their properties; nevertheless, after analyzing their timing, spectral parameters, host-galaxy properties, luminosity function, and volumetric rates, their nature remains uncertain.
Aims:We interpret a sub-sample of nine FXTs that show a plateau or a fast-rise light curve within the framework of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger magnetar model.
Methods:We fit their light curves and derive magnetar (magnetic field and initial rotational period) and ejecta (ejecta mass and opacity) parameters. This model predicts two zones: an orientation-dependent free zone (where the magnetar spin-down X-ray photons escape freely to the observer) and a trapped zone (where the X-ray photons are initially obscured and only escape freely once the ejecta material becomes optically thin). We argue that six FXTs show properties consistent with the free zone and three FXTs with the trapped zone.
Results:This sub-sample of FXTs has a similar distribution of magnetic fields and initial rotation periods to those inferred for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), suggesting a possible association.
We compare the predicted ejecta emission fed by the magnetar emission (called merger-nova) to the optical and near-infrared upper limits of two FXTs, XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 where contemporaneous optical observations are available.

"Starting from the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation and Duhamel’s principle of time-domain wave equations, we propose novel butterfly-compressed Hadamard integrators for self-adjoint wave equations in both time and frequency domain in an inhomogeneous medium. First, we incorporate the leading term of Hadamard’s ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation to develop a short-time valid propagator. Second, using the Fourier transform in time, we derive the corresponding Eulerian short-time propagator in frequency domain; on top of this propagator, we further develop a time-frequency-time (TFT) method for the Cauchy problem of time-domain wave equations. Third, we further propose the time-frequency-time-frequency (TFTF) method for the corresponding point-source Helmholtz equation, which provides Green’s functions of the Helmholtz equation for all angular frequencies within a given frequency band. Fourth, to implement TFT and TFTF methods efficiently, we introduce butterfly algorithms to compress oscillatory integral kernels at different frequencies. As a result, the proposed methods can construct wave field beyond caustics implicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally with quasi-optimal computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, once constructed the Hadamard integrators can be employed to solve both time-domain wave equations with various initial conditions and frequency-domain wave equations with different point sources.

"Information aging has gained prominence in characterizing communication protocols for timely remote estimation and control applications. This work proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame. At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point (AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node. Depending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes, and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may render T-DFSA unstable. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-DFSA compared to the existing optimal frame slotted ALOHA, threshold-ALOHA, and age-based thinning protocols in a considerable range of update generation rates.","['Age of information', 'random access', 'dynamic frame slotted', 'ALOHA', 'Internet of', 'Things', 'stochastic arrivals.']",[]

An a-priori analysis confirms that the previously developed tabulated manifolds fall short of capturing all turbulent flame phenomena,
necessitating a novel manifold incorporating both strain and curvature variations.
These results underscore the significance of these variations in developing manifold-based combustion models for turbulent lean hydrogen flames.","['Turbulent premixed flames', 'Thermodiffusive instability', 'Hydrogen combustion', 'Preferential diffusion', 'Strain and curvature', 'Flamelet modeling']",[]
"Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of indoor mobile robots.
Successful solutions have many applications in multiple scenes.
One of the exceptions is the reflective ground.
In this case,
the reflections on the floor resemble the true world,
which confuses the obstacle discovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful.
We argue that the key to this problem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and obstacles.
Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground plane in 3D space.
With this observation,
we firstly introduce a pre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict the ground plane.
Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection,
this scheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection.
Given the detected ground,
we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel relative to the ground.
Based on this,
a unified appearance-geometry feature representation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes.
Eventually,
based on segmenting by detection framework,
an appearance-geometry fusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the obstacles.
It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of obstacles instead of whole obstacles.
For evaluation,
we introduce a new dataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG),
which comprises 15 scenes with various ground reflections,
a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400 RGB images.
The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a comparison to our method and other methods.
By reducing the misdetection of the reflection,
the proposed approach outperforms others.

"We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the LEGUS sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two galaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC 1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793, especially young massive clusters (<10absent10<10< 10 Myr, >104absentsuperscript104>10^{4}> 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M⊙direct-product{}_{\odot}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT).
Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivities and resolutions of 13 pc, we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to determine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in cluster formation.
By fitting size-linewidth relations for the clouds in each galaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying that its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313 also has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be connected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these virially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters than that of the general cloud population. 
We find surprisingly small differences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two galaxies, though the largest of those differences are that NGC 1313 has higher surface densities and lower free-fall times.","['star formation', 'ALMA spiral galaxies']","['Australia', 'Sweden', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Switzerland']"
"We compare the molecular cloud properties in sub-galactic regions of two galaxies, barred spiral NGC 1313, which is forming many massive clusters, and flocculent spiral NGC 7793, which is forming significantly fewer massive clusters despite having a similar star formation rate to NGC 1313.
We find that there are larger variations in cloud properties between different regions within each galaxy than there are between the galaxies on a global scale, especially for NGC 1313.
There are higher masses, linewidths, pressures, and virial parameters in the arms of NGC 1313 and center of NGC 7793 than in the interarm and outer regions of the galaxies.
The massive cluster formation of NGC 1313 may be driven by its greater variation in environments, allowing more clouds with the necessary conditions to arise, although no one parameter seems primarily responsible for the difference in star formation.
Meanwhile NGC 7793 has clouds that are as massive and have as much kinetic energy as clouds in the arms of NGC 1313, but have densities and pressures more similar to the interarm regions and so are less inclined to collapse and form stars.
The cloud properties in NGC 1313 and NGC 7793 suggest that spiral arms, bars, interarm regions, and flocculent spirals each represent distinct environments with regard to molecular cloud populations.
We see surprisingly little difference in surface densities between the regions, suggesting that the differences in surface densities frequently seen between arm and interarm regions of lower-resolution studies are indicative of the sparsity of molecular clouds, rather than differences in their true surface density.","['star formation', 'ALMA spiral galaxies']","['Australia', 'Sweden', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Switzerland']"

"Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used in always-on safety-critical applications deployed on hardware accelerators (NN-HAs) employing various memory technologies. Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for safety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to single and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation, aging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect transient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications, and require extensive test vector generation and storage.

"DSLR cameras can achieve multiple zoom levels via shifting lens distances or swapping lens types.
However, these techniques are not possible on smartphone devices due to space constraints.
Most smartphone manufacturers adopt a hybrid zoom system: commonly a Wide (W) camera at a low zoom level and a Telephoto (T) camera at a high zoom level.
To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these systems crop and digitally upsample images from W, leading to significant detail loss.
In this paper, we propose an efficient system for hybrid zoom super-resolution on mobile devices, which captures a synchronous pair of W and T shots and leverages machine learning models to align and transfer details from T to W.
We further develop an adaptive blending method that accounts for depth-of-field mismatches, scene occlusion, flow uncertainty, and alignment errors.
To minimize the domain gap, we design a dual-phone camera rig to capture real-world inputs and ground-truths for supervised training.

"We introduce the notion of quota trees in directed graphs. Given a
nonnegative integer “quota” for each vertex of a directed multigraph
G𝐺Gitalic_G, a quota tree is an immersed rooted tree which hits each vertex of
G𝐺Gitalic_G the prescribed number of times. When the quotas are all one, the
tree is actually embedded and we recover the usual notion of a
spanning arborescence (directed spanning tree). The usual algorithms
which produce spanning arborescences with various properties typically
have (sometimes more complicated) “quota” analogues.
Our original motivation for studying quota trees was the problem of
characterizing the sizes of the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes in a
connected deterministic finite-state automaton recognizing a given
regular language. We show that the obstruction to realizing a given
set of M-N class sizes is precisely the existence of a suitable quota
tree.
In this paper we develop the basic theory of quota trees.
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a quota tree (or forest) over a given directed graph with
specified quotas, solving the M-N class size problem as a special
case. We discuss some potential applications of quota trees and
forests, and connect them to the k𝑘kitalic_k lightest paths problem. We give
two proofs of the main theorem: one based on an algorithmic loop
invariant, and one based on direct enumeration of quota trees. For the
latter, we use Lagrange inversion to derive a formula which vastly
generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem and Cayley’s formula for
counting labeled trees. We give an efficient algorithm to sample

"Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition systems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data, unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative bottlenecks.
Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples.
Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL’s superiority over current iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts demonstrate SSRL’s effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks an important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation learning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.","['Self-supervised learning', 'self-labeling', 'knowledge distillation', 'noisy label modeling', 'speaker recognition']",[]

"In terms of human-computer interaction, it is becoming more and more important to correctly understand the user’s emotional state in a conversation, so the task of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) started to receive more attention. However, existing emotion classification methods usually perform classification only once. Sentences are likely to be misclassified in a single round of classification. Previous work usually ignores the similarities and differences between different morphological features in the fusion process. To address the above issues, we propose a two-stage emotion recognition model based on graph contrastive learning (TS-GCL). First, we encode the original dataset with different preprocessing modalities. Second, a graph contrastive learning (GCL) strategy is introduced for these three modal data with other structures to learn similarities and differences within and between modalities. Finally, we use MLP twice to achieve the final emotion classification. This staged classification method can help the model to better focus on different levels of emotional information, thereby improving the performance of the model.

"Sequential recommenders are crucial to the success of online applications, e.g., e-commerce, video streaming, and social media.

In addition, with a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec can improve the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 13.8% in Recall@10 and 29.5% in NDCG@10.

"Real-time safety metrics are important for the automated driving system (ADS) to assess the risk of driving situations and to assist the decision-making. Although a number of real-time safety metrics have been proposed in the literature, systematic performance evaluation of these safety metrics has been lacking. As different behavioral assumptions are adopted in different safety metrics, it is difficult to compare the safety metrics and evaluate their performance. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we propose an evaluation framework utilizing logged vehicle trajectory data, in that vehicle trajectories for both subject vehicle (SV) and background vehicles (BVs) are obtained and the prediction errors caused by behavioral assumptions can be eliminated. Specifically, we examine whether the SV is in a collision unavoidable situation at each moment, given all near-future trajectories of BVs. In this way, we level the ground for a fair comparison of different safety metrics, as a good safety metric should always alarm in advance to the collision unavoidable moment. When trajectory data from a large number of trips are available, we can systematically evaluate and compare different metrics’ statistical performance. In the case study, three representative real-time safety metrics, including the time-to-collision (TTC) [1], the PEGASUS Criticality Metric (PCM) [2] and the Model Predictive Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM) [3], are evaluated using a large-scale simulated trajectory dataset. The results demonstrate that the MPrISM achieves the highest recall and the PCM has the best accuracy. The proposed evaluation framework is important for researchers, practitioners, and regulators to characterize different metrics, and to select appropriate metrics for different applications.

"Specific emitter identification (SEI) technology is significant in device administration scenarios, such as self-organized networking and spectrum management, owing to its high security.
For nonlinear and non-stationary electromagnetic signals, SEI often employs variational modal decomposition (VMD) to decompose the signal in order to effectively characterize the distinct device fingerprint.
However, the trade-off of VMD between the robustness to noise and the ability to preserve signal information has not been investigated in the current literature.
Moreover, the existing VMD algorithm does not utilize the stability of the intrinsic distortion of emitters within a certain
temporal span, consequently constraining its practical applicability in SEI.
In this paper, we propose a joint variational modal decomposition (JVMD) algorithm, which is an improved version of VMD by simultaneously implementing modal decomposition on multi-frame signals.
The consistency of multi-frame signals in terms of the central frequencies and the inherent modal functions (IMFs) is exploited, which effectively highlights the distinctive characteristics among emitters and reduces noise.
Additionally, the complexity of JVMD is analyzed, which is proven to be more computational-friendly than VMD.
Simulations of both modal decomposition and SEI that involve real-world datasets are presented to illustrate that when compared with VMD, the JVMD algorithm improves the accuracy of device classification and the robustness towards noise.","['Intrinsic modal functions (IMFs)', 'radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs)', 'specific emitter identification (SEI)', 'variational mode decomposition (VMD)']",[]
"While significant advancements have been made in video question answering (VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through tailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing research. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a curriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from simpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL methods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not accurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the concept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding principle for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the challenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach for VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation graph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables. This yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent uncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model’s confidence. In practice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and conduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not only achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty in the context of VideoQA.","['Video question answering', 'curriculum learning', 'uncertainty', 'stochastic computation graph.']",[]

"Linear RMS-flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent RMS-flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range 1–150 keV.
As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear RMS-flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope.
Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the RMS-flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk-corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to the reduction of the disk-corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the RMS-flux slope.
In conclusion, we suggest that the RMS-flux slope in 1–150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of the disk-corona coupling and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by the changes in the corona geometry.","['accretion (14) – black holes (162) –', 'High energy astrophysics(739)']",['China']

As the important intermediation of financial products investment, these platforms distribute thousands of mutual funds obtaining impressions under guaranteed delivery (GD) strategy required by fund companies. Driven by the profit from fund purchases of users, the platform aims to maximize each transaction amount of customers by promoting mutual funds to these investors who will be interested in. Different from the conversions in traditional advertising or e-commerce recommendations, the investment amount in each purchase varies greatly even for the same financial product, which provides a significant challenge for the promotion recommendation of mutual funds. In addition to predicting the click-through rate (CTR) or the conversion rate (CVR) as in traditional recommendations, it is essential for FinTech platforms to estimate the customers’ purchase amount for each delivered fund and achieve an effective allocation of impressions based on the predicted results to optimize the total expected transaction value (ETV). In this paper, we propose an ETV-optimized customer allocation framework (EOCA) that aims to maximize the total ETV of recommended funds, under the constraints of GD dealt with fund companies. EOCA consists of two phases: a prediction phase of the customer purchase amount followed by a constrained allocation phase. Specifically, we propose an entire space deep probabilistic model with a novel-designed loss function to predict the purchase amount when a promotional fund is exposed to a user, which involves not only the conversion rate prediction but also the post-conversion purchase amount estimation. Based on the predicted ETV, we design a heuristic algorithm to solve the large-scale constrained combinatorial optimization problem to suggest which fund each user should be exposed to in order to maximize the total purchase amount. To the best of our knowledge, it’s the first attempt to solve the GD problem for financial product promotions based on customer purchase amount prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets and online tests based on LiCaiTong, Tencent’s wealth management platform, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EOCA framework.","['FinTech platform', 'customer allocation', 'purchase amount prediction']",['China']
"This paper explores opportunities and challenges of task (goal)-oriented and semantic communications for next-generation (NextG) communication networks through the integration of multi-task learning. This approach employs deep neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and testing phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder at the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side, highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against potential multi-domain exploits. Overall, the joint and robust design of task-oriented communications, semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communications in a multi-task learning framework emerges as the key enabler for context-aware, resource-efficient, and secure communications ultimately needed in NextG network systems.","['Task-oriented communications', 'semantic communications', 'integrated sensing and communications', 'deep learning', 'multi-task learning', 'distributed learning', 'security.']",[]

"Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving system.
However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency.

"Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited resources, lack of interoperability, etc.
Although patient selection can ensure the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set without missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing modality is 80%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with multi-modal data and missing modality.

"Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) paradigm, an emerging research topic in evolutionary computation, has been successfully applied in solving high-dimensional feature selection (FS) problems recently.
However, existing EMT-based FS methods suffer from several limitations, such as a single mode of multitask generation, conducting the same generic evolutionary search for all tasks, relying on implicit transfer mechanisms through sole solution encodings, and employing single-objective transformation, which result in inadequate knowledge acquisition, exploitation, and transfer.
To this end, this paper develops a novel EMT framework for multiobjective high-dimensional feature selection problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks are constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search spaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with the original task through a multi-slover-based multitask optimization scheme. Each task has an independent population with task-specific representations and is solved using separate evolutionary solvers with different biases and search preferences. A task-specific knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to leverage the advantage information of each task, enabling the discovery and effective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MO-FSEMT framework can achieve overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FS methods on 26 datasets. Moreover, the ablation studies verify the contributions of different components of the proposed MO-FSEMT.","['Feature selection', 'Evolutionary', 'Multitasking', 'High-dimensional classification', 'Multi-objective optimization']",[]
"We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the semantic information desired by different receivers is different but correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation. Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation. It also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one receiver.","['Semantic communications', 'digital modulation', 'superposition coding', 'broadcast channel.']",[]

"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) visual geo-localization aims to match images of the same geographic target captured from different views, i.e., the UAV view and the satellite view.
It is very challenging due to the large appearance differences in UAV-satellite image pairs.
Previous works map images captured by UAVs and satellites to a shared feature space and employ a classification framework to learn location-dependent features while neglecting the overall distribution shift between the UAV view and the satellite view.
In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing distribution alignment of the two views to shorten their distance in a common space.
Specifically, we propose an end-to-end network, called PVDA (Progressive View Distribution Alignment).
During training, feature encoder, location classifier, and view discriminator are jointly optimized by a novel progressive adversarial learning strategy.
Competition between feature encoder and view discriminator prompts both of them to be stronger.
It turns out that the adversarial learning is progressively emphasized until UAV-view images are indistinguishable from satellite-view images.
As a result, the proposed PVDA becomes powerful in learning location-dependent yet view-invariant features with good scalability towards unseen images of new locations.
Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed PVDA requires less inference time but has achieved superior performance on the University-1652 dataset.","['UAV visual geo-localization', 'UAV view satellite view distribution alignment adversarial learning.']",[]
"This paper addresses the task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) visual geo-localization, which aims to match images of the same geographic target taken by different platforms, i.e., UAVs and satellites.
In general, the key to achieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual features that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and rotations.
Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV visual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image details and help to understand the semantic information of scenes.
However, the importance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations is not well discussed.
In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive semantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative semantics in an image.
Correlations of image patches to different parts are learned in terms of the transformer’s feature map.
Then our method decomposes part-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features.
By doing this, the learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics.

"With the increase in the number of electric vehicles (EV), there is a need for the development of the EV charging infrastructure (EVCI) to facilitate fast charging, thereby mitigating the EV congestion at charging stations. The role of the public charging station depot is to charge the vehicle, prioritizing the achievement of the desired state of charge (SoC) value for the EV battery or charging till the departure of the EV, whichever occurs first. The integration of cyber and physical components within EVCI defines it as a cyber physical power system (CPPS), increasing its vulnerability to diverse cyber attacks. When an EV interfaces with the EVCI, mutual exchange of data takes place via various communication protocols like the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), and IEC 61850. Unauthorized access to this data by intruders leads to cyber attacks, potentially resulting in consequences like energy theft, and revenue loss. These scenarios may cause the EVCI to incur higher charges than the actual energy consumed or the EV owners to remit payments that do not correspond adequately to the amount of energy they have consumed. This article proposes an EVCI architecture connected to the utility grid and uses the EVCI data to identify the anomalies or outliers present in the EV transmitted data, particularly focusing on SoC irregularities. The proposed methodology involves utilizing a ridge regression based machine learning (ML) model for predicting changes in the SoC. The adversaries have the capability of spoofing these change in SoC values, consequently making the EVCI incapable of achieving the desired task. Three distinct spoofing techniques namely, decimal shifting, incremental array spoofing, and random spoofing are implemented on the data and subsequently tested with the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed methodology detects the anomaly accurately and also classifies the type of spoofing that causes the anomaly.","['EVCI', 'SoC', 'fast charging', 'spoofing', 'anomaly detection', 'Ridge regression']",[]

"The rapid increase in \acEV adoption provides a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency in transportation systems. However, the increasing numbers of \acEVs pose significant challenges to the electrical grids.

"An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations.
Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal
reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q,
where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge.
Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and
nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic
charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations
during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona.
We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values
in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution.
We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are only about 10-30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.","['The', 'Sun (1693) —', 'Solar', 'Energetic', 'Particles (1491) —', 'Non-thermal radiation sources (1119)']",[]
"Hierarchical beam search in mmWave communications incurs substantial training overhead, necessitating deep learning-enabled beam predictions to effectively leverage channel priors and mitigate this overhead. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive probabilistic model of power distribution in beamspace, and formulate the joint optimization problem of probing beam selection and probabilistic beam prediction as an entropy minimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem, where a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional power distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each iteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes the entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions and the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a two-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected from a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and predictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is identified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power values. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes compared to hierarchical beam search and beam prediction with uniform probing beams.","['mmWave communication', 'beam prediction', 'probing beam selection', 'deep learning', 'entropy minimization.']",[]

"Defining a successful notion of a multivariate quantile has been an open problem for more
than half a century, motivating a plethora of possible solutions. Of
these, the approach of [8] and
[25] leading to M-quantiles, is very appealing for
its mathematical elegance – combining elements of convex analysis and
probability theory. The key idea is the description of a convex
function (the K-function) whose gradient (the K-transform) is in
one-to-one correspondence between all of ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and the unit ball in
ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. By analogy with the d=1𝑑1d=1italic_d = 1 case where the K-transform
is a cumulative distribution function-like object (an M-distribution), the fact that its
inverse is guaranteed to exist lends itself
naturally to providing the basis for the definition of a quantile
function for all d≥1𝑑1d\geq 1italic_d ≥ 1. Over the past twenty years the resulting M-quantiles
have seen applications in a variety of fields, primarily for the
purpose of detecting outliers in multidimensional spaces.
In this article we prove that for odd d≥3𝑑3d\geq 3italic_d ≥ 3, it is not the gradient but a
poly-Laplacian of the K-function that is (almost
everywhere) proportional to the density
function. For d𝑑ditalic_d even one cannot establish a differential equation connecting
the K-function with the density.
These results show that usage of the K-transform for outlier
detection in higher odd-dimensions is in principle flawed,
as the K-transform does not originate from inversion of a true M-distribution.
We demonstrate these conclusions in two dimensions
through examples from non-standard asymmetric distributions. Our
examples illustrate a feature of the K-transform whereby regions in
the domain with higher density map to larger volumes in the co-domain,
thereby producing a magnification effect that moves inliers closer to
the boundary of the co-domain than outliers. This feature obviously
disrupts any outlier detection mechanism that relies on the inverse K-transform.","['multivariate distribution function', 'multivariate quantile', 'geometric quantile', 'outlier detection']",[]

The assumptions of mass action, chemostatic conditions and stationarity in stochastic feeding dynamics lead to Holling type II functional responses, whose use is widespread in macroscopic models of population dynamics. However, to be useful for parameter inference, stochastic population models need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be uniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In this contribution we study parameter identifiability in a multi-resource consumer-resource model, for which we can obtain the steady-state and out-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator’s abundances by analytically solving the master equation. Based on these analytical results, we can conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that are either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. We show that, when model observations are recorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas if sampling is done at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from data. We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of general dynamical models.","['stochastic consumer-resource models', 'master equation', 'out-of-equilibrium distribution', 'parameter inference', 'multi-resource', 'Holling type', 'II feeding dynamics']",['Spain']

"Wireless communication highly depends on the cellular ground base station (GBS). A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas. In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible, mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area’s ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV. The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate, rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge for a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulation results are provided which show that our proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.","['Public safety communication networks (PSCNs)', 'UAVs', 'video transmission', 'resource allocation.']",[]
"Machine learning models underpin many modern financial systems for use cases such as fraud detection and churn prediction. Most are based on supervised learning with hand-engineered features, which relies heavily on the availability of labelled data. Large self-supervised generative models have shown tremendous success in natural language processing and computer vision, yet so far they haven’t been adapted to multivariate time series of financial transactions. In this paper, we present a generative pretraining method that can be used to obtain contextualised embeddings of financial transactions. Benchmarks on public datasets demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on a range of downstream tasks. We additionally perform large-scale pretraining of an embedding model using a corpus of data from 180 issuing banks containing 5.1 billion transactions and apply it to the card fraud detection problem on hold-out datasets. The embedding model significantly improves value detection rate at high precision thresholds and transfers well to out-of-domain distributions.","['transaction embeddings', 'self-supervised learning', 'generative modelling', 'multivariate time series', 'fraud detection']",[]

"E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several organic items and an advertisement, in response to each user’s page view request. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes, directly impacts the platform’s ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad’s payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may result in suboptimal outcomes.

Therefore, this paper proposes a deep automated mechanism that integrates ad auction and allocation, ensuring both IC and Individual Rationality (IR) in the presence of externalities while maximizing revenue and GMV. The mechanism takes candidate ads and the ordered list of organic items as input. For each candidate ad, several candidate allocations are generated by inserting the ad in different positions of the ordered list of organic items. For each candidate allocation, a list-wise model takes the entire allocation as input and outputs the predicted result for each ad and organic item to model the global externalities. Finally, an automated auction mechanism, modeled by deep neural networks, is executed to select the optimal allocation. Consequently, this mechanism simultaneously decides the ranking, payment, and display position of the ad. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism results in higher revenue and GMV than state-of-the-art baselines in offline experiments and online A/B tests.","['Automated', 'Mechanism', 'Design', 'Ad', 'Auction', 'Externalities', 'Ad', 'Allocation']",['China']

Most existing distributed graph optimization algorithms employ a simple sequential partitioning scheme, which may result in unbalanced subgraph dimensions due to the different geographic locations of each robot, and hence imposes extra communication load.
Moreover, the performance of current Riemannian optimization algorithms can be further accelerated.
In this letter, we propose a novel distributed pose graph optimization algorithm combining multi-level partitioning with an accelerated Riemannian optimization method.
Firstly, we employ the multi-level graph partitioning algorithm to preprocess the naive pose graph to formulate a balanced optimization problem.
In addition, inspired by the accelerated coordinate descent method, we devise an Improved Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent (IRBCD) algorithm and the critical point obtained is globally optimal.
Finally, we evaluate the effects of four common graph partitioning approaches on the correlation of the inter-subgraphs, and discover that the Highest scheme has the best partitioning performance.
Also, we implement simulations to quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed pose graph optimization protocols111We make the code available at https://github.com/tjcunhao/distributed-pose-graph..","['Distributed', 'Pose', 'Graph', 'Optimization', 'Graph', 'Partitioning', 'CSLAM', 'Accelerated', 'Riemannian', 'Optimization']",[]

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers various services to users through content creation, which is believed to be one of the most important components in future networks.
However, training and deploying big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and communication overhead.
This poses a critical challenge to centralized approaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and the reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud services.
Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services, partly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI services to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences.
In this paper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big cloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework and a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI services. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence, enhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden.
The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an image generation use case. Finally, we outline fundamental research directions to fully exploit the collaborative potential of edge and cloud for native GenAI and BAIM applications.","['Generative', 'AI', 'big', 'AI model', 'cloud-edge collaboration.']",[]
"In extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems for future sixth-generation (6G) communications, codebook-based beam training stands out as a promising technology to acquire channel state information (CSI). Despite their effectiveness, when the pilot overhead is limited, existing beam training methods suffer from significant achievable rate degradation for remote users with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To tackle this challenge, leverging the error-correcting capability of channel codes, we introduce channel coding theory into hierarchical beam training to extend the coverage area. Specifically, we establish the duality between hierarchical beam training and channel coding, and the proposed coded beam training scheme serves as a general framework. Then, we present two specific implementations exemplified by coded beam training methods based on Hamming codes and convolutional codes, during which the beam encoding and decoding processes are refined respectively to better accommodate to the beam training problem. Simulation results have demonstrated that, the proposed coded beam training method can enable reliable beam training performance for remote users with low SNR, while keeping training overhead low.","['Beam training', 'channel codes', 'hierarchical codebook', 'convolutional codes', 'Hamming codes.']",[]
"Many RGBT tracking researches primarily focus on modal fusion design, while overlooking the effective handling of target appearance changes. While some approaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial templates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting the original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates and multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance changes, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template tokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to address appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial static template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the preservation of the original reliable target appearance information that prevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal updates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of multimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make the multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template tokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of multimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the transformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction, search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on three RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms while running at 39.1 FPS.","['RGBT tracking', 'Transformer', 'Cross-modal interaction', 'Spatio-Temporal', 'Multimodal', 'Tokens.']",[]
"The availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data is increasing along with the availability of different GPS receivers and with the increasing use of various mobility services. GPS trajectory is an important data source which is used in traffic density detection, transport mode detection, mapping data inferences with the use of different methods such as image processing and machine learning methods. While the data size increases, efficient representation of this type of data is becoming difficult to be used in these methods. A common approach is the representation of GPS trajectory information such as average speed, bearing, etc. in raster image form and applying analysis methods. In this study, we evaluate GPS trajectory data rasterization using the spatial join functions of QGIS, PostGIS+QGIS, and our iterative spatial structured grid aggregation implementation coded in the Python programming language. Our implementation is also parallelizable, and this parallelization is also included as the fourth method. According to the results of experiment carried out with an example GPS trajectory dataset, QGIS method and PostGIS+QGIS method showed relatively low performance with respect to our method using the metric of total processing time. PostGIS+QGIS method achieved the best results for spatial join though its total performance decreased quickly while test area size increases. On the other hand, both of our methods’ performances decrease directly proportional to GPS point. And our methods’ performance can be increased proportional to the increase with the number of processor cores and/or with multiple computing clusters.","['Rasterization', 'GPS trajectory', 'Data aggregation', 'Spatial join', 'Parallelization']",[]

In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a directed tree.
We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration influence.
We then consider cascades from information spreading on Twitter to compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms.
The results show that, according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role than expected.

"JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of the transmitted images at the expense of visual perception drop. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information loss in the compression process, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the subsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision models trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when dealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. In recent years, numerous learning-based JPEG artifacts removal methods have been proposed to handle visual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifacts removal methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the following reasons: 1) These methods are designed for human vision rather than high-level vision models. 2) These methods are not efficient enough to serve as a pre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight adaptive feature de-drifting module (AFD-Module) to boost the performance of pre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a Feature Drifting Estimation Network (FDE-Net) is devised to generate the spatial-wise Feature Drifting Map (FDM) in the DCT domain. Next, the estimated FDM is transmitted to the Feature Enhancement Network (FE-Net) to generate the mapping relationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features. Specially, a simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural re-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature representation in the training phase while keeping efficiency in the deployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module can serve as a “plug-and-play” module for pre-trained classification models to improve their performance on compressed images. Experiments on images compressed once (i.e. ImageNet-C) and multiple times demonstrate that our proposed AFD-Module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the pre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing methods.","['JPEG compression', 'Feature', 'Drifting', 'Image', 'Classification', 'Feature', 'Enhancement']",[]

To advance the use of synthetic data for cloth manipulation and to enable tasks such as robotic folding, we present a synthetic data pipeline to train keypoint detectors for almost flattened cloth items. To test its performance, we have also collected a real-world dataset.
We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64.3%. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance to 74.2%. Additional insight is provided by discussing various failure modes of the keypoint detectors and by comparing different approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials.
We also quantify the remaining sim-to-real gap and argue that further improvements to the fidelity of cloth assets will be required to further reduce this gap. The code, dataset and trained models are available at https://github.com/tlpss/synthetic-cloth-data.","['Deep', 'Learning for', 'Visual', 'Perception', 'Simulation and', 'Animation', 'Data', 'Sets for', 'Robotic', 'Vision']",[]
"Benefitting from the vast spatial degrees of freedom, the amalgamation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is expected to simultaneously improve spectral and energy efficiencies as well as the sensing capability.
However, a large number of antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in acquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter information.
To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target sensing problems.
Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions.
Then, we propose a shared training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical expression.
On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the tensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing the specific Vandermonde structure.
Then, we develop a unified tensor-based algorithm to estimate the parameters including angles, time delays, Doppler shifts, and reflection/path coefficients of the targets/channels.
In addition, we propose a segment-based shared training pattern to facilitate the channel and target parameter estimation for the case with significant beam squint effects.
Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed unified algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy, sensing resolution, and training overhead reduction.","['Integrated sensing and communication', 'massive', 'MIMO', 'channel estimation', 'target parameter estimation', 'tensor decomposition.']",[]
"This paper introduces a new type of soft continuum robot, called SCoReS, which is capable of self-controlling continuously its curvature at the segment level; in contrast to previous designs which either require external forces or machine elements, or whose variable curvature capabilities are discrete—depending on the number of locking mechanisms and segments. The ability to have a variable curvature, whose control is continuous and independent from external factors, makes a soft continuum robot more adaptive in constrained environments, similar to what is observed in nature in the elephant’s trunk or ostrich’s neck for instance which exhibit multiple curvatures. To this end, our soft continuum robot enables reconfigurable variable curvatures utilizing a variable stiffness growing spine based on micro-particle granular jamming for the first time. We detail the design of the proposed robot, presenting its modeling through beam theory and FEA simulation—which is validated through experiments. The robot’s versatile bending profiles are then explored in experiments and an application to grasp fruits at different configurations is demonstrated.

This is a challenging, and mostly unaddressed task. Existing methods leverage heuristics and regular expressions, that can be very noisy, and therefore increase toil on developers. The next step - modifying code itself - to automatically remediate a detection, is a complex task. We introduce two baseline AI models that have good detection performance and propose an automatic mechanism for remediating secrets found in code, opening up the study of this task to the wider community.","['artificial intelligence', 'software engineering', 'cybersecurity']",[]

"With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.","['rumor detection', 'multimodal fusion', 'propagation structure', 'social media']",['China']

Green information and communication technology is a paradigm creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly computing field that tries to minimize the adverse effects on the environment.

"It was proposed that the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space is uniquely determined by the Hamiltonian’s spectrum, for most finite-dimensional cases satisfying certain conditions.
I show that, for more than three qudits, any such method can only lead to infinitely many tensor product structures. The number of additional continuous parameters needed to find a unique solution is exponential in the number of qudits. In addition, even if the result were unique, such a Hamiltonian would not entangle subsystems.
These results affect some proposals to recover the 3d space from the Hamiltonian.","['tensor product structure entanglement emergent spacetime', 'Hilbert space fundamentalism.']",[]
"Channel state information (CSI) is important to reap the full benefits of millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The traditional channel estimation methods using pilot frames (PF) lead to excessive overhead. To reduce the demand for PF, data frames (DF) can be adopted for joint channel estimation and data recovery. However, the computational complexity of the DF-based methods is prohibitively high. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a joint channel estimation and data recovery (JCD) method assisted by a small number of PF for mmWave massive MIMO systems. The proposed method has two stages. In Stage 1, differing from the traditional PF-based methods, the proposed PF-assisted method is utilized to capture the angle of arrival (AoA) of principal components (PC) of channels. In Stage 2, JCD is designed for parallel implementation based on the multi-user decoupling strategy. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the PF-assisted JCD method can achieve equivalent performance to the Bayesian-optimal DF-based method, while greatly reducing the computational complexity. Simulation results are also presented to validate the analytical results.","['MmWave massive', 'MIMO', 'joint channel estimation and data recovery', 'PF-assisted', 'principal components.']",[]
"In physics and engineering literature, the distribution of the excursion-above-zero time distribution (exceedance distribution) for a stationary Gaussian process has been approximated by a stationary switching process with independently distributed switching times.
The approach matched the covariance of the clipped Gaussian process with the one for the stationary switching process and the distribution of the latter was used as the so-called independent interval approximation (IIA).
The approach successfully assessed the persistency exponent for many physically important processes but left an unanswered question when such an approach leads to a mathematically meaningful and proper exceedance distribution.
Here we address this question by proposing an alternative matching of the expected values of the clipped Slepian process and the corresponding switched process initiated at the origin.
The method has allowed resolving the mathematical correctness of the matching method for a large subclass of the Gaussian processes with monotonic covariance, for which we provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the IIA.
Within this class, the IIA produces a valid distribution for the excursion time and is represented in an explicit stochastic form that connects directly to the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process.
We compare the excursion level distributions as well as the corresponding persistency exponents obtained through the IIA method with numerically computed exact distributions, and the simulated distribution for several important Gaussian models.
We also argue that for stationary Gaussian processes with a non-monotonic covariance, the IIA fails and should not be used.","['Slepian model', 'Gaussian process', 'level crossing distributions', 'switching process', 'clipped process', 'renewal process']",[]
"This study tasckles the problem of many-objective sequence optimization for semi-automated robotic disassembly operations. To this end, we employ a many-objective genetic algorithm (MaOGA) algorithm inspired by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-III, along with robotic-disassembly-oriented constraints and objective functions derived from geometrical and robot simulations using 3-dimensional (3D) geometrical information stored in a 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the target product. The MaOGA begins by generating a set of initial chromosomes based on a contact and connection graph (CCG), rather than random chromosomes, to avoid falling into a local minimum and yield repeatable convergence. The optimization imposes constraints on feasibility and stability as well as objective functions regarding difficulty, efficiency, prioritization, and allocability to generate a sequence that satisfies many preferred conditions under mandatory requirements for semi-automated robotic disassembly.
The NSGA-III-inspired MaOGA also utilizes non-dominated sorting and niching with reference lines to further encourage steady and stable exploration and uniformly lower the overall evaluation values. Our sequence generation experiments for a complex product (36 parts) demonstrated that the proposed method can consistently produce feasible and stable sequences with a 100% success rate, bringing the multiple preferred conditions closer to the optimal solution required for semi-automated robotic disassembly operations.","['Robotic disassembly', 'Disassembly sequence', 'Many-objective optimization', 'NSGA-III']",[]

"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative technology that can change our daily life.
Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for “automated”, to facilitate mmWave vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative the process via pilot signals. This multimodal data fusion, together with AI, is expected to bring significant advances in “connected” research.","['Vehicular communication', 'mmWave communication', 'sensor fusion', 'machine learning.']",[]

"Energy disaggregation is a promising solution to access detailed information on energy consumption in a household, by itemizing its total energy consumption. However, in real-world applications, overfitting remains a challenging problem for data-driven disaggregation methods. First, the available real-world datasets are biased towards the most frequently used appliances. Second, both real and synthetic publicly-available datasets are limited in number of appliances, which may not be sufficient for a disaggregation algorithm to learn complex relations among different types of appliances and their states. To address the lack of appliance data, we propose two physics-informed data generators: one for high sampling rate signals (kHz) and another for low sampling rate signals (Hz). These generators rely on prior knowledge of the physics of appliance energy consumption, and are capable of simulating a virtually unlimited number of different appliances and their corresponding signatures for any time period. Both methods involve defining a mathematical model, selecting centroids corresponding to individual appliances, sampling model parameters around each centroid, and finally substituting the obtained parameters into the mathematical model. Additionally, by using Principal Component Analysis and Kullback-Leibler divergence, we demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform the previous approaches.","['energy disaggregation', 'non-intrusive load monitoring', 'synthetic data', 'physics-informed methods']",[]

We give an example of such an orbit which is known exactly, and misses all squares together with an explicit finite list of sporadic values: the corresponding semigroup is not thin, but its Zariski closure does not miss squares.

"Context: Cybercrime groups, driven by financial and geopolitical motives, launch advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. The attacks consist of adversarial techniques, which adversaries perform step-by-step by during cyberattacks. Cybersecurity vendors often publish cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, referring to the written artifacts on technical and forensic analysis of the techniques used by the malware in APT attacks. To defend organizations, prevalent techniques used by malware in APT attacks and the association among the techniques need to be identified. Objective: The goal of this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques cataloged in MITRE ATT&CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI reports that MITRE ATT&CK used as citations in the descriptions of the cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370 techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for 37.3% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c) overlapping in their implementations. We identify that obtaining information on the operating and network system of the victim environment is the most prevalent technique and appears in the highest number of recurring pairs. We identify that spear-phishing is the most prevalent way of initial infection. We also identify three prevalent misuses of system functionalities: macro in office documents, registry in Windows, and task scheduler. We also identify that mimicking legitimate users through compromised credentials is the most prevalent persistence-related technique used by malware. Overall, the study quantifies how adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on publicly reported documents. We advocate organizations prioritize their defense against the identified prevalent techniques and actively hunt for potential malicious intrusion based on the identified pairs of techniques.","['Tactics', 'techniques', 'and procedures', 'ATT&CK', 'APT attacks', 'Multi-stage attacks', 'malware', 'cyber-criminal groups', 'cyber-threat actors', 'TTPs', 'Advanced persistent threats', 'Threat hunting', 'Cyberattack']",[]

Interestingly, the best-fitted model implies higher X-ray emission and lower CO content than what is detected observationally, suggesting the presence of a molecular gas component that should be further obscuring the X-ray emission over larger spatial scales than the central region that is being modeled. These results highlight the need for multiline infrared observations to characterize the multiphase gas in high redshift quasars and, in particular, W2246–0526 serves as an extreme benchmark for comparisons of interstellar medium conditions with other quasar populations at cosmic noon and beyond.","['galaxies:', 'ISM – galaxies: nuclei – galaxies: active galaxies: individual (WISE', 'J2246-0526) – quasars: emission lines']",[]
"On 2022 February 15, an impressive filament eruption was observed off the solar eastern limb from three remote-sensing viewpoints, namely Earth, STEREO-A, and Solar Orbiter. In addition to representing the most-distant observed filament at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths—captured by Solar Orbiter’s field of view extending to above 6 R⊙subscript𝑅direct-productR_{\odot}italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—this event was also associated with the release of a fast (∼similar-to\sim∼2200 km⋅⋅\cdot⋅s−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT) coronal mass ejection (CME) that was directed towards BepiColombo and Parker Solar Probe. These two probes were separated by 2∘{}^{\circ}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT in latitude, 4∘{}^{\circ}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ∘ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT in longitude, and 0.03 au in radial distance around the time of the CME-driven shock arrival in situ. The relative proximity of the two probes to each other and to the Sun (∼similar-to\sim∼0.35 au) allows us to study the mesoscale structure of CMEs at Mercury’s orbit for the first time. We analyse similarities and differences in the main CME-related structures measured at the two locations, namely the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic ejecta. We find that, despite the separation between the two spacecraft being well within the typical uncertainties associated with determination of CME geometric parameters from remote-sensing observations, the two sets of in-situ measurements display some profound differences that make understanding of the overall 3D CME structure particularly challenging. Finally, we discuss our findings within the context of space weather at Mercury’s distances and in terms of the need to investigate solar transients via spacecraft constellations with small separations, which has been gaining significant attention during recent years.","['Solar filament eruptions (1981)', 'Solar coronal mass ejections (310)', 'Interplanetary magnetic fields (824)', 'Interplanetary shocks (829)']","['Germany', 'Spain', 'Finland', 'Austria', 'Belgium', 'Romania']"
"Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.","['Advanced persistent threat', 'Tactics', 'Techniques', 'and', 'Procedures', 'ATT&CK', 'Temporal pattern', 'Cyberthreat intelligence', 'CTI reports', 'Knowledge graph', 'attack graph']",[]
"Relativistic jets accompany the collapse of massive stars, the merger of compact objects, or the accretion of gas in active galactic nuclei. They carry information about the central engine and generate electromagnetic radiation. No self-consistent simulations have been able to follow these jets from their birth at the black hole scale to the Newtonian dissipation phase, making the inference of central engine property through astronomical observations undetermined. We present the general relativistic moving-mesh framework to achieve the continuity of jet simulations throughout space-time. We implement the general relativistic extension for the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamic code-JET, and develop a tetrad formulation to utilize the HLLC Riemann solver in the general relativistic moving mesh code. The new framework is able to trace the radial movement of the relativistic jets from the central region where strong gravity holds all the way to distances of jet dissipation.","['General', 'Relativistic', 'Relativistic jet', 'HLLC']",['Germany']

satisfies the unital infinitesimal condition with each magmatic product, and prove an analog of Aguiar-Sottile’s formula in this context, describing the coproduct in terms of the Moebius basis for the Tamari order. The last result allows us to compute the subspace of primitive elements of any unital infinitesimal S𝑆Sitalic_S-magmatic bialgebra. As an example, we construct a set of generators of the dual of Pilaud and Pons bialgebra of integer relations and compute an explicit basis of its subspace of primitive elements.","['Magmatic algebras', 'bialgebras', 'Tamari order', 'binary rooted trees']",[]
"As time progresses, the need for more secure applications grows exponentially. The different types of sensitive information that is being transferred virtually has sparked a rise in systems that leverage blockchain. Different sectors are beginning to use this disruptive technology to evaluate the risks and benefits. Sectors like finance, medicine, higher education, and wireless communication have research regarding blockchain. Futhermore, the need for security standards in this area of research is pivotal. In recent past, several attacks on blockchain infrastructures have resulted in hundreds of millions dollars lost and sensitive information compromised. Some of these attacks include DAO attacks, bZx attacks, and Parity Multisignature Wallet Double Attacks which targeted vulnerabilities within smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These attacks exposed the weaknesses of current smart contract development practices which has led to the increase in distrust and adoption of systems that leverage blockchain for its functionality. In this paper, I identify common software vulnerabilities and attacks on blockchain infrastructures, thoroughly detail the smart contract development process and propose a model for ensuring a stronger security standard for future systems leveraging smart contracts. The purpose for proposing a model is to promote trust among end users in the system which is a foundational element for blockchain adoption in the future.","['Smart', 'Contract', 'Blockchain', 'Software', 'Development', 'Cybersecurity']",[]

"In recent years, foundation models (FMs) have solidified their role as cornerstone advancements in the deep learning domain. By extracting intricate patterns from vast datasets, these models consistently achieve state-of-the-art results across a spectrum of downstream tasks, all without necessitating extensive computational resources [1].
Notably, MedCLIP [2], a vision-language contrastive learning-based medical FM, has been designed using unpaired image-text training. While the medical domain has often adopted unpaired training to amplify data [3], the exploration of potential security concerns linked to this approach hasn’t kept pace with its practical usage. Notably, the augmentation capabilities inherent in unpaired training also indicate that minor label discrepancies can result in significant model deviations. In this study, we frame this label discrepancy as a backdoor attack problem. We further analyze its impact on medical FMs throughout the FM supply chain. Our evaluation primarily revolves around MedCLIP, emblematic of medical FM employing the unpaired strategy. We begin with an exploration of vulnerabilities in MedCLIP stemming from unpaired image-text matching, termed BadMatch. BadMatch is achieved using a modest set of wrongly labeled data. Subsequently, we disrupt MedCLIP’s contrastive learning through BadDist-assisted BadMatch by introducing a Bad-Distance between the embeddings of clean and poisoned data. Intriguingly, when BadMatch and BadDist are combined, a slight 0.05 percent of misaligned image-text data can yield a staggering 99 percent attack success rate, all the while maintaining MedCLIP’s efficacy on untainted data. Additionally, combined with BadMatch and BadDist, the attacking pipeline consistently fends off backdoor assaults across diverse model designs, datasets, and triggers. Also, our findings reveal that current defense strategies are insufficient in detecting these latent threats in medical FMs’ supply chains.

"Visual scenes are extremely diverse, not only because there are infinite possible combinations of objects and backgrounds but also because the observations of the same scene may vary greatly with the change of viewpoints. When observing a multi-object visual scene from multiple viewpoints, humans can perceive the scene compositionally from each viewpoint while achieving the so-called “object constancy” across different viewpoints, even though the exact viewpoints are untold. This ability is essential for humans to identify the same object while moving and to learn from vision efficiently. It is intriguing to design models that have a similar ability. In this paper, we consider a novel problem of learning compositional scene representations from multiple unspecified (i.e., unknown and unrelated) viewpoints without using any supervision and propose a deep generative model which separates latent representations into a viewpoint-independent part and a viewpoint-dependent part to solve this problem. During the inference, latent representations are randomly initialized and iteratively updated by integrating the information in different viewpoints with neural networks. Experiments on several specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed method can effectively learn from multiple unspecified viewpoints.","['compositional scene representations', 'object-centric learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'deep generative models', 'variational inference', 'object constancy.']",[]

"“Changing-look” Active Galactic Nuclei (CL-AGNs) are challenging our basic ideas about the physics of accretion flows and of circumnuclear gas around supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
Using first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously-known AGNs, combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopic observations, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems.
Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is among the largest reported to date, and includes ∼0.4%similar-toabsentpercent0.4\sim 0.4\%∼ 0.4 % of the AGNs re-observed in the first year of SDSS-V operations.
Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening.
Our data and sample probe extreme AGN spectral variability on timescales of months to decades, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales (≲2less-than-or-similar-toabsent2\lesssim 2≲ 2 months in the rest frame).
We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower Eddington ratio (fEddsubscript𝑓Eddf_{\mathrm{Edd}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a fEddsubscript𝑓Eddf_{\mathrm{Edd}}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT distribution that significantly differs from that of a redshift- and a carefully constructed, luminosity-matched control sample (pKS≲2×10−4less-than-or-similar-tosubscript𝑝KS2superscript104p_{\rm KS}\lesssim 2\times 10^{-4}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_KS end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≲ 2 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT; median fEdd≈0.025subscript𝑓Edd0.025f_{\mathrm{Edd}}\approx 0.025italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≈ 0.025 vs. 0.0430.0430.0430.043).
